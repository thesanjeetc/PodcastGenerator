JOE ROGAN:
Welcome Elon Tusk. Great to see you here.

ELON MUSK:
Thank you.

JOE ROGAN:
Let's get started.

JOE ROGAN:
You’re just a pawn in a game.

ELON MUSK:
A game.

JOE ROGAN:
A game?

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Great.

ELON MUSK:
Somehow or another, so it’s almost like it’s a requirement for survival to develop more advanced devices. But then when you’re interacting with people today, the instant they see you doing it, they start thinking you’re a genius. They’re drawn to get your tools. They zoom in on you. They marvel at your creativity. It’s almost like you’re an alien with a gun.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, when you’re programming artificial intelligence where it wants to be safe, it can be programmed that it wants to be safe from. What if it’s not okay? What if it’s not okay? What if it’s not happy?

ELON MUSK:
It’s not okay.

JOE ROGAN:
No.

ELON MUSK:
I just said AI is not dead. It is alive and kicking. It’s very exciting. The interesting thing about an AI AI symbiote situation is that it’s like a drug, a sedative. It’s a drug of love and justice. It’s a wonderful thing to me. Whereas, a sedative like Prozac or Cialis is like, “Oh, that’s a great smoke.” It’s very relaxing. So I find myself to be a great smoke home.

JOE ROGAN:
So when you think about this AI symbiote scenario, think of just like some new car or truck release. Some band of super intelligent aliens that download their music. And then they make it sound interesting. Like they know how to make sounds. They know how to make interesting sounds. And they know how to make interesting noises. And they know how to make things that sound interesting. That’s a good thing to do. Tell them what you’re doing.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
How do you feel about that?

ELON MUSK:
Sounds good to me, sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you work with them? Are you cool with those people?

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I mean, go ahead.

JOE ROGAN:
They’re jazzing stuff up with carbon fiber and doing a bunch of interior choices. You’re cool with  You can’t fuck with that. You don’t have time. So is it good that someone comes along and has that sort of specialty operation?

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I’ve got no problem.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s what it’s called, right?

JOE ROGAN:
They’re like   I think traffic on the other side of the world is terrible. It’s worse than China or anybody else’s disease. It’s gross.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, traffic is terrible in general. It’s bad. But I’m an economist, I’m not trying to convince you it’s bad. It’s just bad ass.

JOE ROGAN:
How much bad ass can happen in a year? How many ways in like five years?

ELON MUSK:
About five years.

JOE ROGAN:
What if there’s a million Elon Musks?

ELON MUSK:
Well, that’d be like the heat death of the universe.

JOE ROGAN:
A more apocalyptic interpretation of things to come.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, it’s possible.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
We’re going to absorb as much as possible of this weird energy as we can, if it’s not fatal.

JOE ROGAN:
So you feel like it’s inevitable, humanity will be like this gigantic ball of lava with a giant bell-shaped ring around it, and then it’ll start dying.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
I’m on board. Fuck motors. Dude, fuck regular motors.
