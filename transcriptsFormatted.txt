JOE ROGAN:
Ha, ha, ha. Four, three, two, one. Boom. Thank you. Thanks for doing this, man. Really appreciate it.

ELON MUSK:
Your welcome.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s very good to meet you.

ELON MUSK:
Nice to meet you too.

JOE ROGAN:
And thanks for not lighting this place on fire.

ELON MUSK:
Your welcome. That’s coming later.

JOE ROGAN:
How does one, just in the middle of doing all the things you do, create cars, rockets, all this stuff you’re doing, constantly innovating, decide to just make a flame thrower  Why do you have the time for that 

ELON MUSK:
Well, the thing  I wouldn’t put a lot of time into the flame thrower. This was an off the cuff thing. So I have sort of like a, sort of a hobby company called The Boring Company, which started out as a joke, and we decided to make it real, and dig a tunnel under L.A. And then other people asked us to dig tunnels. And so we said yes in a few cases.

ELON MUSK:
And we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time. And we started off with a cap. And there was only one thing on  It was just Boring Company.com/cap or hat. That’s it. And then we sold the hats. Limited edition. It just said the Boring Company. And then I’m a big fan of Spaceballs the movie. And in Spaceballs Yogurt goes through the merchandising section and they have a flame thrower, in the merchandising section of Spaceballs. And the kids loved that one. That’s the line of when he pulls out the flame thrower. So I was like, we should do a flame thrower. So we 

JOE ROGAN:
Does anybody tell you no  Does anybody go, “Elon, um, maybe for yourself. But selling a flame thrower, the liabilities, all the people you’re selling this devise to. What kind of an unhinged people are going to be buying a flame thrower in the first place  Do we really want to connect ourselves to all these potential arsonists ”

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it’s a terrible idea. Terrible. You shouldn’t buy one. I said don’t buy this flame thrower. Don’t buy it. Don’t buy it. That’s what I said. But still people bought it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. They’re not gonna listen.

ELON MUSK:
There’s nothing I can do to stop them. I cannot stop them.

JOE ROGAN:
You build it, they will come.

ELON MUSK:
I said don’t buy it. It’s a bad idea.

JOE ROGAN:
How many did you make 

ELON MUSK:
It’s dangerous. It’s wrong. Don’t buy it. And still people bought it. I just couldn’t stop them.

JOE ROGAN:
How many did you make 

ELON MUSK:
20,000.

JOE ROGAN:
And they’re all gone 

ELON MUSK:
In three, I think four days. They sold out in four days.

JOE ROGAN:
Are you gonna do another run 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
No, that’s it 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I said we would do 20,000. We did 50,000 hats. And that was a million dollars. And I was like, okay, we’ll sell something for 10 million. And that was 20,000 flame throwers at $500 each. They went fast.

JOE ROGAN:
How do you have the time to do that though. I mean, I understand that it’s not a big deal, in terms of all the other things that you do. But how do you have time to do anything  I just don’t understand your time management skills.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, I didn’t spend much time on this flame thrower. I mean, to be totally frank, it’s actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle cover. It’s not a real flame thrower.

JOE ROGAN:
Which is why it says not a flame thrower.

ELON MUSK:
That’s why we were very clear. This is not actually a flame thrower. And also we were told that various countries would band shipping of it. That they would band flame throwers. So we varied to solve this problem for all the custom agencies, we labeled it not a flame thrower.

JOE ROGAN:
Did it work  Was it effective 

ELON MUSK:
I don’t know. I think so. Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
So far.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, but you do 

ELON MUSK:
Cause they said you could not ship a flame thrower.

JOE ROGAN:
But you do so many different things. Forget about the flame thrower. Like, how do you do all that other shit  Like, how does one decide to fix L.A. traffic by drilling holes in the ground  And who do you even approach with that  Like, when you have this idea, who do you talk to about that 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, I’m not saying it’s going to be successful. You know, I’m not asserting that it’s going to be successful. But so far I’ve lived in L.A. for 16 years, and the traffic has always been terrible. And so I don’t see any other ideas for improving the traffic. So, in desperation, we are going to dig a tunnel. And maybe that tunnel will be successful and maybe it won’t.

JOE ROGAN:
I’m listening.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I’m not trying to convince you it’s going to work.

JOE ROGAN:
And are the people that you 

ELON MUSK:
Or anyone.

JOE ROGAN:
But you are starting this though. This is actually a project you’re starting to implement. Right 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. We’ve dug about a mile. It’s quite long. It takes a long time to walk it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Now, when you’re doing this, what is the ultimate plan  The ultimate plan is to have these in major cities, and anywhere there’s mass congestion, and just try it out in L.A. first 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It’s in L.A. because I mostly live in L.A. That’s the reason. It’s a terrible place to dig tunnels. This is one of the worst place to dig tunnels, because the  Mostly because of the paperwork. People think it’s like, what about seismic. It’s like, actually, tunnels are very safe in earthquakes.

JOE ROGAN:
Why is that 

ELON MUSK:
Earthquakes are essentially a surface phenomenon. It’s like waves on the ocean. So if there’s a storm, you want to be in a submarine. So being in a tunnel is like being in a submarine. Now the way the tunnel’s constructed is it’s constructed out of these interlocking segments. Kind of like a snake. It’s sort of like a snake exoskeleton with double seals. And so, even when the ground moves the tunnel is actually able to shift along with the ground. Like an underground snake. And it doesn’t crack or break. And it’s extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken. And it’s incapable of taking five atmospheres of pressure. It’s water proof, methane proof, or gas proof of any kind. And meets all California seismic requirements.

JOE ROGAN:
So when you have this idea, who do you bring this to 

ELON MUSK:
I’m not sure what you mean by that.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, when you’re implementing it. So you’re digging holes in the ground.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Like, you have to bring it to someone that lets you do it.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, so, there were some engineers from SpaceX who thought it would be cool to do this. And the guy who runs the day to day, Steve Davis, he’s a long time space engineer. He’s great. So, Steve was like, “I’d like to help make this happen.” I was like, cool.

ELON MUSK:
So we started off with digging a hole in the ground. Just got like a permit for a pit, a big pit, and just dug a big pit.

JOE ROGAN:
And you had to tell them what the pit’s for  Or you just, uh, hey, we just want to dig a hole 

ELON MUSK:
They just fill out this form.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s it 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It was put in our parking lot.

JOE ROGAN:
But do you have to give them some sort of blueprint for your ultimate idea  And do they have to approve it  Like, how does that work 

ELON MUSK:
No, we just started off with the pit.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
A big pit. And they don’t really care about the existential nature of a pit. You just say I want a pit.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
You know  And it’s a hole in the ground. So then we have a permit for the pit and we dug the pit. And we dug in in, I don’t know, three days, two or three days. Actually I think 48 hours. Something like that. Cause Eric   said he was coming by for the hype  He was gonna attend the Hyperloop competition. Which is a student competition we have for who can make the fastest pod in the hyperloop.

ELON MUSK:
And he was coming. The finals were going to be on Sunday afternoon. And so Eric was coming by on Sunday afternoon and I was like, you know, we should dig this pit and then show Eric. And this was like, Friday morning. And then, yeah, it was about a little over 40 hours. And 40 hours later we dug the pit. It was like we’re in 24/7 or 24. 48 straight hours. Something like that. And dug this big pit. And we’re like, showed Eric the pit. Like, obviously it’s just a pit. But hey, a hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground.

JOE ROGAN:
And what did you tell him about this pit  I mean, you just said this is the beginning of this idea 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
We’re gonna build tunnels under L.A. to help funnel traffic better.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And they just go, okay  But we’ve joked around about this in the podcast before. To like, what other person can go to the people that run the city and go, “Hey, we’re gonna did some holes under ground and put some tunnels in there.” And they go, “Oh yeah, okay.”

ELON MUSK:
Nothing wrong with a hole in the ground. People dig holes in the ground all the time.

JOE ROGAN:
But my question is, like, I know how much time you must be spending on your Tesla factory. I know how much time you must be spending on SpaceX. And yet you still have time to dig holes under the ground in L.A. and come up with these ideas, and then implement them.

ELON MUSK:
I got a million ideas.

JOE ROGAN:
I’m sure you do.

ELON MUSK:
There’s no shortage of that. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
I just don’t know how you manage your time. I don’t understand it. It doesn’t even seem humanly possible.

ELON MUSK:
You know, I do basically  I think people like don’t totally understand what I do with my time. They think that I’m a business guy or something like that. On my Wikipedia page it says business magnate.

JOE ROGAN:
What would you call yourself 

ELON MUSK:
A business magnet. Could someone please change my Wikipedia page to magnet 

JOE ROGAN:
They’ll change it right now.

ELON MUSK:
Please change it to 

JOE ROGAN:
It’s probably already changed.

ELON MUSK:
It’s locked. So somebody has to be able to unlock it and change it to magnet.

JOE ROGAN:
Someone will get that.

ELON MUSK:
I want to be a magnet. I do engineering, and manufacturing, and that kind of thing. That’s like 80 percent or more of my time.

JOE ROGAN:
Ideas and then implementation of those ideas.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it’s like hardcore engineering.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Like designing things, you know.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Structural, mechanical, electrical, software, user interface, engineering, aerospace engineering.

JOE ROGAN:
But you must understand there’s not a whole lot of human beings like you. You know that right  To us you’re an oddity-

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
-to chimps like me.

ELON MUSK:
We’re all chimps.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah we are.

ELON MUSK:
We’re one notch above a chimp.

JOE ROGAN:
Some of us are little bit more confused. When I watch you do all these things I’m like, how does this mother fucker have all this time, and all this energy, and all these ideas, and then people just let him do these things 

ELON MUSK:
Because I’m an alien.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s what I’ve speculated.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
That I’m on record saying this in the past. I wonder.

ELON MUSK:
It’s true.

JOE ROGAN:
It there was one. I was like if there was like maybe an intelligent being that we created. You know, like some A.I. creature that’s superior to people. Then they would just hang around us for a little while like you’ve been doing. And then fix a bunch of shit. I mean, that’s the way.

ELON MUSK:
I might have some mutation or something like that.

JOE ROGAN:
You might. Do you think you do 

ELON MUSK:
Probably.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you wonder  Like, when you’re around normal people you’re like, hmm. Like, what’s up with these boring dumb mother fuckers  Ever 

ELON MUSK:
Not bad for a human. But I thing we will not be able to hold a candle to A.I.

JOE ROGAN:
You scare the shit out of me when you talk about A.I. Between you and Sam Harris.

ELON MUSK:
Oh sure.

JOE ROGAN:
I didn’t even consider it until I had a podcast with Sam once-

ELON MUSK:
That’s great.

JOE ROGAN:
-and he made me shit my pants. Talking about A.I., I realize like, oh, well this is a genie that once it’s out of the bottle you’re never getting it back in.

ELON MUSK:
That’s true.

JOE ROGAN:
There was a video that you tweeted about one of those Boston dynamic robots.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And you were like, in the future it’ll be moving so fast you can’t see it without a strobe light.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. You could probably do that right now.

JOE ROGAN:
And no one’s really paying attention to much. Other than people like you or people that are really obsessed with technology. All these things are happening. These robots are  Did you see the one where PETA put out a statement that you shouldn’t kick robots 

ELON MUSK:
Probably not wise.

JOE ROGAN:
For retribution.

ELON MUSK:
Their memory is very good.

JOE ROGAN:
I bet it’s really good.

ELON MUSK:
It’s really good.

JOE ROGAN:
I bet it is.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And getting better every day.

ELON MUSK:
It’s really good.

JOE ROGAN:
Are you honestly, legitimately concerned about this  Is A.I. one of your main worries in regards to the future 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. It’s less of a worry than it used to be. Mostly due to taking more of a fatalistic attitude.

JOE ROGAN:
So you used to have more hope and you gave up some of it, and now you don’t worry as much about A.I. You’re like, this is just what it is 

ELON MUSK:
Pretty much. No, it’s not necessarily bad. It’s just, it’s definitely going to be outside of human control.

JOE ROGAN:
Not necessarily bad, right 

ELON MUSK:
It’s not necessarily bad. It’s just outside of human control. Now the thing that’s going to be tricky here is that it’s going to be very tempting to use A.I. as a weapon. It’s going to be very tempting. In fact, it will be used as a weapon. So the on ramp to serious A.I., the danger is going to be more humans using it against each other I think. Most likely. That’ll be the danger. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
How far do you think we are from something that can make its own mind up whether or not something ethically or morally correct, or whether or not it wants to do something, or whether or not it wants to improve itself, or whether or not it wants to protect itself from people, or from other A.I. How far away are we from something that’s really, truly sentient 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean, you could argue that any group of people, like, a company is essentially a cybernetic collective of people and machines. That’s what a company is. And then there are different levels of complexity in the way these companies are formed. And then there are sort of this collective A.I. in the Google sort of search. Google search. You know, where we’re all sort of plugged in as like nerds on the network. Like leaves on a big tree. We’re all feeding this network with our questions and answers. We’re all collectively programming the A.I. And Google plus all the humans that connect to it are one giant cybernetic collective.

ELON MUSK:
This also true of Facebook, and Twitter, and Instagram, and all these social networks. They’re giant cybernetic collectives.

JOE ROGAN:
Humans and electronics all interfacing. And constantly now. Constantly connected 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Constantly.

JOE ROGAN:
One of the things that I’ve been thinking about a lot over the last few years is, that one of the things that drives a lot of people crazy is how many people are obsessed with materialism and getting the greatest thing. And I wonder how much of that is  Well, a lot of it is most certainly fueling technology and innovation. It almost seems like it’s built in to us. It’s like what we like and what we want. That we’re fueling this thing that’s constantly around us all the time. And it doesn’t seem possible that people are going to pump the breaks. It doesn’t seem possible at this stage where we’re constantly expecting newest cellphone, the latest Tesla update, the newest MacBook Pro. Everything has to be newer and better.

JOE ROGAN:
And that’s going to lead to some incredible point. And it seems like it’s built into us. It almost seems like it’s an instinct that we’re working towards this. That we like it. That our job, just like the ants build the ant hill, our job is to somehow to fuel this.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I made those comments some years ago. But it feels like we are the biological boot loader for A.I. effectively. We are moving it. And then we’re building progressively greater intelligence. And the percentage of intelligence that is not human is increasing. And eventually we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence.

ELON MUSK:
But the A.I. is informed, strangely, by the human limbic system. It is in large part our  .

JOE ROGAN:
How so 

ELON MUSK:
We mentioned all those things. The sort of primal drives-

JOE ROGAN:
Mm-hmm  .

ELON MUSK:
-as all the things that we like, and hate, and fear. There all there on the internet. They’re a projection of our limbic system. It’s true.

JOE ROGAN:
No, it makes sense. The thinking of it as a  Thinking of corporations and just thinking of just human beings communicating online through these social media networks as some sort of an organism that’s a cyborg. It’s combination. It’s a combination of electronics and biology.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. And some measure, like the success of these online systems, is sort of a function of how much limbic resonance they’re able to achieve with people. The more limbic resonance, the more engagement.

JOE ROGAN:
Whereas, like, one of the reasons probably Instagram is more enticing than Twitter.

ELON MUSK:
Limbic resonance.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. More images, more video.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Tweaking your system more.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you worry or wonder, in fact, about what the next step is  I mean, a lot of people didn’t see Twitter coming. That, you know, communicating with 140 characters, or 280 now, would be a thing that people would be interested in. Like, it’s gonna excel, it’s gonna become more connected to us, right 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Things are getting more and more connected. They’re, at this point, constrained by  . Our input/output is slow. Particularly output. Output got worse with thumbs. You know, we used to have input with ten fingers. Now we have thumbs. But images are also a way of communicating at high bandwidth. You take pictures and you send pictures to people. That communicates far more information that you can communicate with your thumbs.

JOE ROGAN:
So what happened with you where you decided, or you took on a more fatalistic attitude  Was there any specific thing  Or was it just the inevitability of our future 

ELON MUSK:
I try to convince people to slow down, slow down A.I., to regulate A.I. This was futile. I tried for years. But nobody listened.

JOE ROGAN:
This seems like a scene in a movie where the robots are gonna fucking take over. You’re freaking me out. Nobody listened 

ELON MUSK:
Nobody listened.

JOE ROGAN:
No one  Are people more inclined to listen today  It seems like an issue that’s brought up more often over the last few years than it was maybe five, ten years ago, it seemed like science fiction.

ELON MUSK:
Maybe they will. So far they haven’t. I think people don’t  Like, normally the way that regulations work is very slow. It’s very slow indeed. So, usually there will be something. Some new technology. It will cause damage or death. There will be an outcry. There will be an investigation. Years will pass. There will be some sort of incite committee. There will be rule making. Then there will be oversight. Eventually regulations. This all takes many years. This is the normal course of things.

ELON MUSK:
If you look at say, automotive regulations. How long did it take for seat belts to be implemented, to be required  You know, the auto industry fought seat belts, I think, for more than a decade. Successfully fought any regulations on seat belts. Even though the numbers were extremely obvious. If you had a seatbelt on you would be far less likely to die or be seriously injured. It was unequivocal.

ELON MUSK:
And the industry fought this for years, successfully. Eventually after many, many people died, regulators insisted on seat belts. This timeframe is not relevant to A.I. You can’t 10 years from the point at which is dangerous. It’s too late.

JOE ROGAN:
And you feel like this is decades away or years away from being too late  If you have this fatalistic attitude and you feel like it’s going to  We’re in an almost like a doomsday countdown.

ELON MUSK:
It’s not necessarily a doomsday countdown. It’s a 

JOE ROGAN:
Out of control countdown 

ELON MUSK:
Out of control. Yeah. People call it the singularity. And that’s probably a good way to think about it. It’s a singularity. It’s hard to predict. Like a black hole. What happens past the event horizon 

JOE ROGAN:
Right. So once it’s implemented it’s very difficult  cause it will be able to 

ELON MUSK:
Once the genie gets out of the bottle what’s going to happen 

JOE ROGAN:
Right. And it will be able to improve itself.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s where it gets spooky, right  The idea that it can do thousands of years of innovation very, very quickly.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And then we’ll be just ridiculous.

ELON MUSK:
Ridiculous.

JOE ROGAN:
We will be like this ridiculous biological shitting pissing thing trying to stop the gods. No stop. We like living with a finite life span and watching Norman Rockwell paintings.

ELON MUSK:
It could be terrible and it could be great. It’s not clear.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
But one thing is for sure, we will not control it.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think that it’s likely that we will emerge somehow or another with this sort of technology, and it will augment what we are now  Or do you think it will replace us 

ELON MUSK:
Well, that’s the scenario, the emerge scenario with A.I. is the one that seems like probably the best.

JOE ROGAN:
For us 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Like, if you can’t beat it, join it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
You know  So, from a long term existential standpoint, that’s like the purpose of neuro link. Is to create a hight bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbiotic with A.I. Cause we have a bandwidth problem. We just can’t communicate through. It goes through too slow.

JOE ROGAN:
And where’s neuro link at right now 

ELON MUSK:
I think we’ll have something interesting to announce in a few months. That’s at least in order of magnitude rather that anything else. I think better that probably anyone thinks is possible.

JOE ROGAN:
How much can you talk about that right now 

ELON MUSK:
I don’t want to jump the gun on that.

JOE ROGAN:
But what’s like the ultimate  What’s the idea behind it  What are you trying to accomplish with it  What would you like  Best case scenario.

ELON MUSK:
I think best case scenario we effectively merge with A.I. where A.I. serves as a   cognition layer where we got the limbic system. The primitive brain essentially. You got the cortex. So you’re currently in a symbiotic relationship. Your cortex and limbic system are in a symbiotic relationship. And generally people like their cortex and they like their limbic system. I haven’t met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or delete their cortex. Everybody seems to like both.

ELON MUSK:
And the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system. People may think that the thinking part of themselves is in charge, but it’s mostly the limbic system that’s in charge. And the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy. That’s what most of that computing power is going towards, how can I make the limbic system happy. That’s what it’s trying to do.

ELON MUSK:
Now, If we do have a third layer, which is the A.I. extension of yourself that is also symbiotic, and there’s enough bandwidth between the cortex and the A.I. extension of yourself such that the A.I. doesn’t defacto separate, then that could be a good outcome. That could be quite a positive outcome for the future.

JOE ROGAN:
So instead of replacing us, it will radically change our capabilities 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. It will enable anyone who wants to have super human cognition. Anyone who wants. It is not a matter of earning power, because your earning power would be vastly greater after you do it. So it’s just like anyone who wants can just do it, in theory. That’s the theory.

ELON MUSK:
And if that’s the case, then let’s say billions of people do it, then the outcome for humanity will be the sum of human will. The some of billions of people’s desire for the future.

JOE ROGAN:
Billions of people with enhanced cognitive ability.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Radically enhanced 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And which would be  But how much different than people today  Like if you had to explain it to a person who didn’t really understand what you were saying. How much different are you talking about  When you say radically improved, like, what do you mean  Do you mean mind reading 

ELON MUSK:
It would be difficult to really appreciate the difference. It’s kind of like how much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without. Your vastly smarter actually. You know, you could answer any question if you’re connected to the internet. You can answer any question pretty much instantly. Any calculation. That your phone’s memory is essentially perfect. You can remember flawlessly. Your phone can remember videos, pictures, everything perfectly.

ELON MUSK:
Your phone is already an extension of you. You’re already a cyborg. Most people don’t realize they are already a cyborg. That phone is an extension of yourself. It’s just that the data rate, the rate at which the communication rate between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself, that is your phone and computer, is slow. It’s very slow. And that’s like a tiny stroll of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. And we need to make that tiny stroll like a giant river. A huge high bandwidth interface. It’s an interface problem. Data rate problem.

ELON MUSK:
You solve the data rate problem and I think we can hang on to human machines and biosis through the long term. And then people may decide that they want to retain their biological self or not. I think they will probably choose to retain their biological self.

JOE ROGAN:
Versus some sort of   scenario where they download themselves into at computer 

ELON MUSK:
You will be essentially snap shotted into a computer at any time. If your biological self dies you can just probably upload into a new unit. Literally.

JOE ROGAN:
Pass that whiskey. We’re getting crazy over here. This is getting ridiculous.

ELON MUSK:
Down the rabbit hole.

JOE ROGAN:
Grab that sucker. Give me some of that. This is too freaky.

ELON MUSK:
I’ve been thinking about this for a long time by the way.

JOE ROGAN:
I believe you have. If i was talking to on of my  Cheers by the way.

ELON MUSK:
Cheers. Hey, this is some great whiskey.

JOE ROGAN:
Thank you. I don’t know where this came from. Who brought this to us 

 

JOE ROGAN:
Somebody gave it to us. Old Camp. Whoever it was, thanks.

ELON MUSK:
It’s good.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it is good. This is just inevitable. Again, going back to when you decided to have this fatalistic viewpoint. So, you tried to warn people. You talked about this pretty extensively. I’ve read several interviews where you talked about this. And then you just sort of said, okay, it just is. And in a way you’re, by communicating the potential fear. I mean, for sure you’re getting the warning out to some people 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, I was really going on the warning quite a lot. Warning everyone I could. Even met with Obama and just for one reason, like, you better watch out.

JOE ROGAN:
Just to talk about A.I. 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And what did he say  He said what about Hillary. Worry about her first. Shhh. Everybody be quiet.

ELON MUSK:
No, he listened. He certainly listened. I met with congress. I was at meeting with all 50 governors and talked about just the A.I. danger. And I talked to everyone I could. No one seemed to realize where this was going.

 

ELON MUSK:
No one seemed to realize where this was going.

JOE ROGAN:
Is it that or do they just assume that someone smarter than them has already taken care of it  Because when people hear about something like AI, it’s almost abstract. It’s almost like it’s so hard to wrap your head around it  

ELON MUSK:
It is.

JOE ROGAN:
  by the time it already happens it will be too late.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I think they didn’t quite understand it or didn’t think it was near term or not sure what to do about it. I feel like an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee, government committee, to gain insight before you oversight, before you do regulations just try to understand what’s going on. And then you have an insight committee and once they learn what’s going on, get up to speed, then they can make maybe some rules or propose some rules. And that would be probably a safer way to go about things.

JOE ROGAN:
It seems   I know that it’s probably something that the government is supposed to handle but it seems like I wouldn’t want   I don’t want the government to handle this.

ELON MUSK:
Who do you want to handle it 

JOE ROGAN:
I want you to handle this.

ELON MUSK:
Oh, do you 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. I feel like you’re the one who could ring the bell better. Because if Mike Pence starts talking about AI, I’m like, “Shut up, bitch. You don’t know anything about AI.” Come on, man. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, but I don’t have the power to regulate other companies. What am I supposed to   

JOE ROGAN:
Right. But maybe companies could agree. Maybe there could be sort of a   We have agreements where you’re not supposed to dump toxic waste into the ocean. You’re not supposed to do certain things that could be terribly damaging even though they’d be profitable. Maybe this is one of those things. Maybe we should realize that you can’t hit the switch on something that’s going to be able to think for itself and make up its own mind as to whether or not it wants to survive or not. And whether or not it thinks you’re a threat. And whether or not it thinks you’re useless. Like, “Why do I keep this dumb, finite life form alive. Why keep this thing around  It’s just stupid. It just keeps polluting everything. It’s shitting everywhere it goes, lighting everything on fire and shooting each other. Why would I keep this stupid thing alive. Because sometimes it makes good music  Sometimes it makes great movies and sometimes it makes beautiful art and sometimes it’s cool to hang out with.”

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. All those reasons.

JOE ROGAN:
For us, those are great reasons. But for anything objective, standing outside, I’d go, “Oh, this is definitely a flawed system.” This is like if you went to the jungle and you watched these chimps engage in warfare and beat each other up.

ELON MUSK:
Chimps are really mean.

JOE ROGAN:
They’re fucking real mean.

ELON MUSK:
Fucking mean.

JOE ROGAN:
They’re real mean.

ELON MUSK:
I saw that movie Chimpanzee. I thought it was going to be like some Disney thing. I was like, “Holy Cow.”

JOE ROGAN:
What movie was that 

ELON MUSK:
It was a movie called Chimpanzee.

JOE ROGAN:
Is it a documentary 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It’s kind of like a documentary. I was like, “Damn these chimps are mean.”

JOE ROGAN:
They’re mean.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. They’re cruel.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. They’re calculated.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
They sneak up on each other.

ELON MUSK:
I didn’t realize chimps calculated cruelty. I left that movie kind of like, “Whoa. This is dark.”

JOE ROGAN:
Right, well we know better because we’ve advanced. But if we hadn’t we’d be like, “Man I don’t want to fucking live in a house. I like the chimp ways, bro. Chimps ways go. This is it, man. Chimp life.”

ELON MUSK:
Chimp life.

JOE ROGAN:
But we, in a way, to the AI might be like those chimps. And like, “These stupid fucks launching missiles out of drones and shooting each underwater.” Like we’re crazy. We’ve got torpedoed submarines and fucking airplanes that drop nuclear bombs indiscriminately on cities. We’re assholes.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
They might go, “Why are they doing this.” They might like look at our politics, look at what we do in terms of our food system, what kind of food we force down each other’s throats. And might go, “These people are crazy. They don’t even look out for themselves.”

ELON MUSK:
I don’t know. How much do we think about chimps. Not much.

JOE ROGAN:
Very little.

ELON MUSK:
It’s like these chimps are at war. These groups of chimps just attack each other and they kill each other and they torture each other. It’s pretty bad. They hunt monkeys. This is probably the most   I mean, when’s the last time you talked about chimps 

JOE ROGAN:
Me 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
All the time.

ELON MUSK:
You do 

JOE ROGAN:
You’re talking to the wrong guy. This fucking podcast, dude, I talk about chimps ever episode.

ELON MUSK:
Chimp city  Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
People are laughing right now. Yeah. Constantly. I’m obsessed. I saw that David Attenborough documentary on chimps where they were eating those colobus monkeys and ripping them apart.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. This was rough. Gruesome.

JOE ROGAN:
I saw that many, many years ago. It changed how I  . “Oh, this is why people are so crazy. We came from that thing.”

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Exactly. And there’s the bonobos. They’ve got a better philosophy.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, they’re like swingers. They really are. They seem to be way more – even than us – way more civilized.

ELON MUSK:
They just seem to resolve everything with sex.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. The only rules they have is the mom won’t bang the son. That’s it.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s it. Mom won’t bang her sons. They’re good women. Good women of bonobos community. Everybody else is banging it out.

ELON MUSK:
I haven’t seen the bonobos movie.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, they’re disturbing just at a zoo. You have bonobos at a zoo.

ELON MUSK:
They’re just constantly going 

JOE ROGAN:
They’re constantly fucking. Yeah. That’s all they do.

ELON MUSK:
  stuff.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. And they don’t care. Gay. Straight. Whatever. Let’s just fuck. What’s with these labels 

ELON MUSK:
I haven’t seen bonobos at a zoo. That was probably not in the PG section.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I don’t think they have them at many zoos. We’ve looked that up before too.

ELON MUSK:
It’s probably pretty awkward.

JOE ROGAN:
I think that’s a thing. They like to keep regular chimps at zoos because bonobos just always jacking off and fucking.

 

JOE ROGAN:
What’s that  They have the in San Diego 

ELON MUSK:
San Diego’s has got them.

JOE ROGAN:
Really. Interesting. Probably separate them.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, how many other in the cage  It’s going to be pretty intense.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. What a weird thing. And I’ve often wondered whether or not we’re   our ultimate goal is to give birth to some new thing, and that’s why we’re so obsessed with technology. Because it’s not like this technology is really   I mean, it’s certainly enhancing our lives in a certain way. But ultimately is it making people happier right now  Most technology, I would say no. In fact you and I were talking about social media before this, about just not having Instagram on your phone and not dealing   You feel better.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I think one of the issues with social media that’s been pointed out by many people is that, I think maybe particularly Instagram, people look like they have a much better life than they really do.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. By design.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. People are posting pictures of when they’re really happy. They’re modifying those pictures to be better looking. Even if they’re not modifying the pictures, they’re at least selecting the pictures for the best lighting, the best angle. So people basically seem   They’re way better looking than they basically really are. And they’re way happier seeming than they really are.

ELON MUSK:
So if you look at everyone on Instagram you might think, “Man, there are all these happy, beautiful people. And I’m not that good looking and I’m not happy. So I must suck.” You know, and that’s going to make you feel sad. So when, in fact, those people you think are super happy actually not that happy. Some of them are really depressed. They’re very sad. Some of the happiest seeming people, actually some of the saddest people in reality.

ELON MUSK:
And nobody looks good all the time. It doesn’t matter who you are.

JOE ROGAN:
No. It’s not even something you should want. Why do you want to look great all the time 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Exactly. So I think things like that can make people quite sad. Just by comparison. Because people generally think of themselves relative to others. We are constantly rebaselining our expectations. And you can see this, say, if you watch some show like Naked and Afraid or if you just go and try living in the woods by yourself for a while. And you’re like, “Civilization is quite great.” People want to come back to civilization pretty fast on Naked and Afraid.

JOE ROGAN:
Wasn’t that a Thoreau quote, that comparison is the thief of joy 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Or happiness is reality minus expectations.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s great too. But the comparison is the thief of joy really holds true to   Is it 

ELON MUSK:
Theodore Roosevelt.

JOE ROGAN:
Roosevelt. Fascinating. And when you’re thinking about Instagram, because what essentially Instagram is with a lot of people is you’re giving them the opportunity to be their own PR agent. And they always go towards the glamorous. And when anybody does show, you know #no filter, they really do do that. “Oh, you’re so brave. Look at you. No make up.” They look good anyway. You look great. What are you doing. Oh my god, you don’t have makeup on. You still look hot as fuck. You know what you’re doing. I know what you’re doing too. They’re letting you know and then they’re feeding off that comment section. Oooh, just look. Sitting there like it’s a fresh stream of love. Like you’re getting right up to the source as it comes out of the earth and you’re sucking that sweet, sweet love water.

ELON MUSK:
A lot of emojis. Emojis. Emojis. A lot of emojis.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. My concern is not so much what Instagram is, is that I didn’t think the people had the need for this or the expectation for some sort of technology that allows them to constantly get love and adulation from strangers, and comments, and this ability to project this sort of distorted version of who you really are. But I worry about where it goes. Like what’s the next one  What’s the next one  Where is it  Is it going to be augmented  Some sort of a weird augmented or virtual sort of Instagram type situation, where you’re not going to want to live in this real world  You’re going to interface with this world that you’ve created through your social media page. Some next level thing.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Go live in the simulation. In the simulation.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Some Ready Player One type shit that’s real. We have that HTC Vive here. I’ve only done it a couple of times quite honestly because it kind of freaks me out. My kids fucking love it, man. They love it. They love playing these weirdo games and walking around with that headset on. But part of me watching them do it goes, “Wow. I wonder if this is like the precursor ” Just sort of like if you look at that phone that Gordon Gekko had on the beach.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, big cell phone.

JOE ROGAN:
And you compare that to a Galaxy Note 9. How the fuck did that become that  Right  And I wonder when I see this HTC Vive, I’m like, “What is that thing going to be 10 years from now when we’re making fun of what it is now ” How ingrained, and how connected and interconnected, is this technology going to be in our life 

ELON MUSK:
It will be at some point indistinguishable from reality.

JOE ROGAN:
Where we’ll lose this. We’ll lose this. Like you and I are just looking at each other through our eyes. I see you. You see me.

ELON MUSK:
Are we 

JOE ROGAN:
I think. I hope.

ELON MUSK:
You think so.

JOE ROGAN:
I think you probably have regular eyes.

ELON MUSK:
This could be some simulation.

JOE ROGAN:
It could be. Do you entertain that 

ELON MUSK:
Well, the argument for the simulation is quite strong because if you assume any improvements at all over time, any improvement, 1%, .1%, just extend the time frame. Make it a thousand years, a million years. The universe is 13.8 billion years old. Civilization, if you’re very generous, civilization is maybe seven or eight thousand years old, if you count it from the first writing. That is nothing. That is nothing.

ELON MUSK:
So if you assume any rate of improvement at all then games will be indistinguishable from reality. Or civilization will end. One of those two things will occur. Therefore we are most likely in a simulation, because we exist.

JOE ROGAN:
Or, we’re on our way to one. Right 

JOE ROGAN:
We could most certainly be on the road. We could be on the road to that, right  It doesn’t mean that it has to have already happened.

ELON MUSK:
It could be a base reality. It could be in base reality.

JOE ROGAN:
We could be here now, on our way to the destination where this could never happen again. Where we are completely ingrained in some sort of an artificial technology, or some sort of a symbiotic relationship with the internet or the next level of sharing information. But right now we’re not there yet. That’s possible too, right  It’s possible that a simulation is one day going to be inevitable. That we’re going to have something that’s indistinguishable from regular reality  But maybe we’re not there yet. That’s also possible.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, it is.

JOE ROGAN:
That we’re not quite there yet. That this is real, when I touch that wood.

ELON MUSK:
Feels very real.

JOE ROGAN:
Maybe that’s why everybody’s into like Mason jars and shit.

ELON MUSK:
Mason jars.

JOE ROGAN:
Suede shoes. People are into craft restaurants and they want raw wood. Everyone wants to see metal. It seems like people are longing towards some weird log cabin type nostalgia.

ELON MUSK:
Sure. Reality.

JOE ROGAN:
Like holding on. Like clinging.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Dragging their nails through the mud, like “Don’t take me yet.”

ELON MUSK:
Yes. But then people will go get a Mason jar with a wine stem or handle. That’s dark. Makes me lose faith in humanity.

JOE ROGAN:
Mason jar with a wine stem and a handle. They have those 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, those   people. That’s just assholes. That’s like people make pet rocks.

ELON MUSK:
Rough.

JOE ROGAN:
Some people are just assholes. They take advantage of our generous nature.

ELON MUSK:
It was made with a wine stem, made with a handle.

JOE ROGAN:
They made it that way 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
So one maker welded it onto the Mason  

ELON MUSK:
That would be fine if they glued it on or something. But it was made that way.

JOE ROGAN:
White trash chic. Oh, this is disgusting. Look at it. There is is right there.

ELON MUSK:
Pretty harsh. Yep.

JOE ROGAN:
This is terrible. That’s like fake breasts that are designed to be hard, like fake breasts from the ’60s. If you really long for the ones with ripples, here we go. Yeah. That’s almost what that is.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
What are you going to do, man  There’s nothing you can do to stop certain terrible idea from propagating.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Anyway I don’t want to sound like things are too dark because I think you have to be optimistic about the future. There’s not point in being pessimistic. It’s just to negative.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s doesn’t help.

ELON MUSK:
It doesn’t help. You know I think you want to be   My theory is you’d rather be optimistic. I’d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right. Or on that side. Because if you’re pessimistic you’re just going to be miserable.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Nobody wants to be around you anyway if it’s the end of the world, like, “I fucking told you, bro. The world is ending.” It is want it is.

ELON MUSK:
Enjoy the journey.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. If you really want to get morose, it is what it is for all of us anyway. We’re all going to   unless something changes.

ELON MUSK:
Yep. Ultimately even if we just sort of existed as humans forever we’d still eventually, that’d be like the heat death of the universe a zillion years from now.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. Even if we get past the sun. We figure out a way past the sun running out of juice.

ELON MUSK:
Eventually it’s going to end. It’s just a question of when.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
So it really is all about the journey.

JOE ROGAN:
Hmmm. Or transcendence, from whatever we are now into something that doesn’t worry about death.

ELON MUSK:
The universe as we know it will dissipate into a fine mist of cold nothingness eventually.

JOE ROGAN:
And then someone’s going to bottle it and put a fragrance to it. Sell it to French people in another dimension.

ELON MUSK:
It’s just a very long time. So I think it’s really just about how can we make it last longer.

JOE ROGAN:
Are you a proponent of the multi universes theory  Do you believe that there are many, many universes, and that even if this one fades out that there’s other ones that are starting fresh right now and there’s an infinite number of them  They’re just constantly in this never-ending cycle of birth and death.

ELON MUSK:
I think most likely, this is just about probability there are many, many simulations. These simulations, you might as well call them reality. Or you could call them multiverse.

JOE ROGAN:
These simulations you believe are created  Like someone has manufactured   

ELON MUSK:
They’re running on the substrate.

JOE ROGAN:
So  . 

ELON MUSK:
That substrate is probably boring.

JOE ROGAN:
Boring 

ELON MUSK:
Mm-hmm  .

JOE ROGAN:
How so 

ELON MUSK:
Well, when we create a simulation, like a game or a movie, it’s the distillation of what’s interesting about life. You know it takes a year to shoot an action movie. And then that’s all distilled down into two or three hours. So, let me tell you, if you’ve seen an action movie being filmed it’s frigging   it’s boring. It’s super boring. It takes lots of takes because everything is on a green screen. Looks pretty goofy. Doesn’t look cool. But once you add the CGI and have great editing, it’s amazing.

ELON MUSK:
So I think most likely if we’re a simulation it’s really boring outside the simulation. Because why would you make a simulation that’s boring  You’d make simulation way more interesting than base reality.

JOE ROGAN:
This is if this right now is a simulation 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And ultimately, inevitably, as long as we don’t die or get hit by a meteor, we’re going to create some sort of simulation if we continue on the same technological path we’re on right now. But we might not be there yet. So it might not be a simulation here  But it most likely is you feel other places 

ELON MUSK:
This notion of place or where is a  

JOE ROGAN:
Flawed 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
A flawed perception 

ELON MUSK:
If you have that sort of Vive that’s made by Value, and HTC. It’s really Valve that did it. HTC did the hardware but it’s really a Valve thing.

JOE ROGAN:
Makers of Half-Life.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Valve. Great company.

JOE ROGAN:
Great company.

ELON MUSK:
When you’re in that virtual reality, which is only going to get better, where are you  Where are you really 

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
You’re aren’t anywhere. You’re in the computer.

JOE ROGAN:
What defines where you are 

ELON MUSK:
Exactly. It’s your perception.

JOE ROGAN:
Is it your perceptions or is it a scale that we have one your butt  You’re right here. I measured you. You’re the same weight as you were when you left. Meanwhile your experience is radically different.

ELON MUSK:
Why do you think you are where you are right now  You might not be.

JOE ROGAN:
I’ll spark up a joint if you keep talking. Your manager is going to come in here. We might have to lock the door.

ELON MUSK:
Right now you think you’re in a studio in LA.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s what I heard.

ELON MUSK:
You might be in a computer.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, listen, man. I think about this all the time. Yeah. It’s unquestionable that one day that will be the case as long as we keep going. As long as nothing interrupts us. And if we start from scratch and we’re single celled organisms all over again. And then millions and millions of years later we become the next thing that is us, with creativity and the ability to change the environment. It’s going to keep monkeying with things until it figures out a way to change reality. To change   almost like punch a hole through what is this thing into what it wants it to be and create new things. And then those new things will intersect with other people’s new things. And it’ll be this ultimate pathway of infinite ideas and expression. All through technology.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And then we’re going to wonder why are we here  What are we doing 

ELON MUSK:
Let’s find out. I mean I think we should take the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes. Right. Right. Right.

ELON MUSK:
And then reevaluate those actions to make sure that it’s true.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, I think there’s a movement to that, I mean in terms of a social movement. I think some of it’s misguided and some of it’s exaggerated. And there’s a lot of people that are fighting for their side out there. But it seems like the general trend of social awareness seems to be much more heightened now than it’s ever been in any other time in history because of our ability to express ourselves instantaneously to each other, through Facebook or Twitter or what have you. And that the trend is to abandon preconceived notions, abandon prejudice, abandon discrimination, and promote kindness and happiness as much as possible.

JOE ROGAN:
Look at this knife. Somebody gave it to me.

ELON MUSK:
What is it 

JOE ROGAN:
What the fuck did you do  Oh, my friend Donny. He brought this with him and it just stayed here. I have a real samurai sword if you want to play with that. I know you’re into weapons. That’s from the 1500s. Samurai sword at the end of the table.

ELON MUSK:
Really  That’s cool.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. I’ll grab it. Hold on. Yeah. That’s a legit samurai sword from an actual samurai, from 1500s. If you pull out that blade. That blade was made the old way, where a master craftsman  

ELON MUSK:
Folded metal 

JOE ROGAN:
  folded that metal and hammered it down over and over again over a long period of time, and honed that blade into what it is now. What’s crazy is that more than 500 years later that thing is still pristine. Whoever took care of that and passed it down to the next person who took care of it, until it got to the podcast room. It’s pretty fucking crazy.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
One day someone is going to be looking at a Tesla like that. These fucking back doors, they pop off sideways. Like a Lamborghini.

ELON MUSK:
You should see what the Tesla can do. I’ll show you afterwards.

JOE ROGAN:
I’ve driven one. I love them.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, but most people don’t know what it can do.

JOE ROGAN:
In terms of like ludicrous mode  In terms of like driving super fast and irresponsibly on public roads  Is that what you’re saying 

ELON MUSK:
Oh, any car can do that.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. What can it do that I need to know about 

ELON MUSK:
The Model X can do this like ballet thing to the Trans Siberian Orchestra. It’s pretty cool.

JOE ROGAN:
Where it dances 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Legitimately  Like moves around da da da 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Why would you program that into a car 

ELON MUSK:
Seemed like fun.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s what I get about you. That’s what’s weird. Like when you showed up here you were all smiles, and you pull out a fucking blow torch and not a blow torch, but I’m like, “Look at this dude.”

ELON MUSK:
Not a flamethrower.

JOE ROGAN:
Now a flamethrower. I’m like, “He’s having fun.”

ELON MUSK:
I want to be clear. It’s definitely not.

JOE ROGAN:
You’re having fun. This thing. You program a car to do a ballet dance.

ELON MUSK:
It’s great.

JOE ROGAN:
You’re having fun. How do you have the time to do that. I don’t understand. While you’re digging holes under the earth, and sending rockets into space, and powering people in Australia, how the fuck do you have time to make the car dance ballet 

ELON MUSK:
Well, in that case there were some engineers at Tesla that said, “What if we make this car dance and play music ” I was like, “That sounds great. Please do it. Let’s try to get it done in time for Christmas.” We did.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there a concern about someone just losing their mind and making it do that on the highway 

ELON MUSK:
No, it won’t do that.

JOE ROGAN:
What if it’s in bumper to bumper traffic 

ELON MUSK:
Nope.

JOE ROGAN:
No, won’t do it.

ELON MUSK:
Nope. Actually you have to   it’s an Easter egg.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, it’s an Easter egg.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. That’s why people don’t know about it, including people that have the car. It can do lots of things.

JOE ROGAN:
Once Reddit gets a hold of it, everyone’s going to know.

ELON MUSK:
If you search for it on the internet you will find out, but people don’t know that they should even search for it.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, well, they do now.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
There are so many things about the Model X, and the Model S, and the Model 3, that people don’t know about. We should probably do a video or something to explain it because I have close friends of mine and I say, “Do you know the car can do this ” And they’re like, “Nope”.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you want to do a video though  Do you like the fact that some people don’t know 

ELON MUSK:
No, I think it’s probably not   We should tell people.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, probably.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
That would help your product. I mean like it’s not like you don’t sell enough of them. You sell almost too many of them, right 

ELON MUSK:
I mean I think a Tesla is the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever. That’s what it’s meant to be. Our goal is to make   It’s not exactly a car. It’s actually a thing to maximize enjoyment, make maximum fun.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay. Electronic. Like big screen. Laptop. Ridiculous speed. Handling. All that stuff.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. And we’re going to put video games in it.

JOE ROGAN:
You are 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It that wise 

ELON MUSK:
Well  .

JOE ROGAN:
What kind of video games 

ELON MUSK:
Well, you won’t be able to drive while you’re playing the video game. For example we were just putting the Atari Emulator, ROM emulator in it. So it will play Missile Command and Lunar Lander and a bunch of other things.

JOE ROGAN:
Ooh, that sound cool.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It’s pretty fun.

JOE ROGAN:
I like that.

ELON MUSK:
And we improved the interface of Missile Command because it’s too hard with the old track bulb. So there’s a touch screen version of Missile Command, so you have a chance.

JOE ROGAN:
You have an old car, don’t you  Don’t you have an old Jaguar 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I do. ’61 series 1 E-Type Jaguar.

JOE ROGAN:
I love cars.

ELON MUSK:
It’s great.

JOE ROGAN:
I love old cars.

ELON MUSK:
The only two gasoline cars I have are that, and a Ford Model T that a friend of mine gave me. That’s my only two gasoline cars.

JOE ROGAN:
Is the Ford Model T all stocked. Oh, there’s your car. Ooh, look at that.

ELON MUSK:
I have the convertible.

JOE ROGAN:
That is a glorious car.

ELON MUSK:
Soft top.

JOE ROGAN:
God that’s good-looking car.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Is that yours 

ELON MUSK:
It’s not mine. It’s extremely close to mine. But I don’t have a front license plate on mine.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, it’s a beautiful car. They nailed that.

ELON MUSK:
Mine looks like that.

JOE ROGAN:
God, they nailed that.

ELON MUSK:
That’s what mine looks like. Maybe that is mine.

JOE ROGAN:
There’s certain iconic shapes. And there’s something about those cars, too. They’re not as capable, not nearly as capable as like a Tesla, but there’s something really satisfying about the mechanical aspect, of like feeling the steering, and the grinding of the gears, and the shifting. There’s something about those that’s extremely satisfying even though they’re not that competent. I have a l993 Porsche 964. It’s like a lightweight   It’s an RS America. It’s not very fast, not in comparison to a Tesla or anything like that. But thing about it is, it’s mechanical. You can feel everything. It gives you this weird thrill, like you’re on this clinky ride and there’s all this feedback. There’s something to that, right 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. My E-Type is basically no electronics.

JOE ROGAN:
So you like that but you also like electronics 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Like your Tesla, it’s like that far end of electronics.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Drives itself.

ELON MUSK:
It’s driving itself better every day. We’re about to release the software that will enable you to just turn in on and it will drive from highway on-ramp to highway exit, do lane changes, overtake other cars, go from one interchange to the next. If you get on, say the 405 and get off 300 miles later and go through several highway interchanges and just overtake other cars and hook into the nav system.

JOE ROGAN:
And you’re just meditating. Om.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
While your car’s just traveling. Om.

ELON MUSK:
It’s kind of eerie. It’s kind of eerie.

JOE ROGAN:
What did you think when you saw that video of that dude falling asleep behind the wheel. I’m sure you’re seen it. The one in San Francisco. He’s like right outside of San Jose. Dude’s out cold, like this. And the car is in bumper to bumper traffic, moving along. You’ve seen it, right 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Yeah. We changed the software. That’s I think an old video. We changed the software where if you don’t touch the wheel it will gradually slow down and put the emergency lights on and wake you up.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, that’s hilarious. That’s hilarious. Can you choose what voice wakes you up 

ELON MUSK:
Well, it sort of honks.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, it honks.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
You should be like, “Wake up, fuck face. You’re endangering your fellow humans.”

ELON MUSK:
We could gently wake you up with a sultry voice.

JOE ROGAN:
Ah, that would be good. Like something with a Southern accent. “Hey, wake up.”

ELON MUSK:
“Wake up, sunshine.”

JOE ROGAN:
“Hey, sweetie.”

ELON MUSK:
Exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
“Won’t you wake up ”

ELON MUSK:
You could pick what you want.

JOE ROGAN:
Like Siri. Yeah, I’d choose the Australian girl for Siri. I like her voice. It’s my favorite.

ELON MUSK:
Do you want it seductive 

JOE ROGAN:
I like Australian.

ELON MUSK:
What flavor  So you want it to be angry  It could be anything.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you want those Australian prison lady jeans. Now when you program something like that in, is this in response to a concern or is it your own   Do you look at it and go, “Hey, they shouldn’t just be able to fall asleep. Let’s wake them up.”

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It’s like, we were like, people are falling asleep, we’ve got to do something about that.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, but when you first released it, you didn’t consider it, right  You’re just like, “No one’s going to just sleep.”

ELON MUSK:
People fall asleep in cars all the time.

JOE ROGAN:
All the time.

ELON MUSK:
And crash. At least our car doesn’t crash. That’s better. It’s better not to crash. Imagine if that guy had fallen asleep in a gasoline car. They do it all the time.

JOE ROGAN:
For sure.

ELON MUSK:
And they would crash into somebody.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
In fact, the thing that really got me to   It was like, “Man, we’d better get autopilot going, get it out there” was a guy was in an early Tesla driving down the highway and he fell asleep. And he ran over a cyclist and killed him. It’s like, “Man, if we had autopilot, he might have fallen asleep, but he wouldn’t have run over that cyclist.”

 

ELON MUSK:
  sleep, but at least he wouldn’t run over that cyclist.

JOE ROGAN:
So how did you implement it  Like, did you just use cameras-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
  programmed with the system, so that if it sees images, it slows down  And how much time do you   Is the person who’s in control of it allowed to program how fast it goes 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Yeah, you can program it to be more or less   like more conservative, or like more aggressive driver, and you can say what speed you want it to   what speed is okay.

JOE ROGAN:
I know you have Ludicrous mode. Do you have douchebag mode 

ELON MUSK:
Well, in-

JOE ROGAN:
It just cuts people off.

ELON MUSK:
Well, for lane changes, it’s tricky, because if you’re in like LA, unless you’re pretty aggressive, it’s hard to change lanes sometimes.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s hard to be satnam. It’s hard to be namaste while out here in LA.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
If you want to hit that Santa Monica Boulevard off-ramp.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, you got to be a little pushy.

JOE ROGAN:
You got to be a little pushy, yeah, especially-

ELON MUSK:
On the freeway.

JOE ROGAN:
  when people are angry.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
People that are angry, they don’t want to let you in. They speed up.

ELON MUSK:
Sometimes, you know, I think people overall are pretty nice on the highway, even in LA, but sometimes they’re not.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think the neural link will help that  Clink.

ELON MUSK:
Probably.

JOE ROGAN:
Everybody be locked in together, this hive mind.

ELON MUSK:
Tunnels will help it. We won’t have traffic.

JOE ROGAN:
That’ll help a lot.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
How many of those can you put in there 

ELON MUSK:
Nice thing about tunnels-

JOE ROGAN:
  for everybody 

ELON MUSK:
Nice thing about tunnels is you can go 3D, so you can go many levels.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, until you hit hell.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, but you could have 100 levels of tunnel, no problems.

JOE ROGAN:
Jesus Christ. I don’t want to be on 99. Imagine being on the 99th, negative 99 floors  Hoo.

ELON MUSK:
This is one of the fundamental things people don’t appreciate about tunnels, is it’s not like roads. The fundamental issue with roads is that you have a 2D transport system and a 3D living and workspace environment, so you’ve got all these tall buildings, or concentrated work environments, and then you want to go into this 2D transport system, which-

JOE ROGAN:
Hugely inefficient.

ELON MUSK:
  pretty low density, because cars are spaced out pretty far. So that obviously is not going to work. You’re going to have traffic, guaranteed. But if you can go 3D on your transport system, then you can solve all traffic. You can either go 3D up, with a flying car, or you can go 3D down with tunnels. You can have as many tunnel levels as you want, and you can arbitrarily relieve any amount of traffic. You can go further down with tunnels than you can go up with buildings. You can go 10,000 feet down if you want. I wouldn’t recommend it, but-

JOE ROGAN:
What was that movie with what’s his face, with Bradley   Not Bradley Cooper. No, what the fuck’s his name  Batman. Who was Batman 

 

JOE ROGAN:
Christian Bale, where they fought dragons, him and Matthew McConaughey. They went down deep into the Earth. How deep can you go-

ELON MUSK:
I don’t think that was Batman.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it was. It was-

ELON MUSK:
Batman fought dragons underground 

JOE ROGAN:
No, it wasn’t Batman, but it was Christian Bale.

 

JOE ROGAN:
Reign of Fire.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
You never saw that 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Terrible movie. Terrible movie, but good. Terrible but good at the same time.

ELON MUSK:
I wouldn’t recommend drilling super far down. The Earth is a big-

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, but you get real deep, it gets hot, right 

ELON MUSK:
  molten   We’re-

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Earth is a giant ball of lava with a thin crust on the top, which we think of as like the surface, this thin crust, and it’s mostly just a big ball of lava. That’s Earth. But 10,000 feet’s not a big deal.

JOE ROGAN:
Have you given any consideration whatsoever to the flat Earth movement 

ELON MUSK:
I think that’s a troll situation.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, it’s not. No, it’s not. You would like to think that because you’re a super genius, but I, as a normal person, I know there’s people way dumber than me, and they really, really believe. They watch YouTube videos, which go on uninterrupted and spew out a bunch of fucking fake facts, very eloquently and articulately, and they really believe. These people really believe.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, if it works for them, sure. Fine.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s weird, though, right, that in this age, where there’s ludicrous mode in your car, goes 1.9 seconds zero to 60.

ELON MUSK:
It’s 2.2.

JOE ROGAN:
2.2  Which one’s 1.9  The Roadster 

ELON MUSK:
The next-generation Roadster, standard edition.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. I’m on top of this shit.

ELON MUSK:
That’s without-

JOE ROGAN:
Standard edition 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it’s without the performance package.

JOE ROGAN:
What  Performance package 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
What the fuck do you need 

ELON MUSK:
We’re going to put rocket thrusters on it.

JOE ROGAN:
For real 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
What are they going to burn 

ELON MUSK:
Nothing. Ultra high pressure compressed air.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa. Just air 

ELON MUSK:
Cold gas thrusters.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, do you have to have air tanks, or-

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
  are they sucking air out of   Okay.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it’s an electric pump. Pump it up to like 10,000 PSI.

JOE ROGAN:
And how fast are we talking, zero to 60 

ELON MUSK:
How fast do you want to go 

JOE ROGAN:
I want to go instantaneously.

ELON MUSK:
We could make it just fly-

JOE ROGAN:
I want to go back in time.

ELON MUSK:
I could make it fly.

JOE ROGAN:
You could make it fly 

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you anticipate that as being   I mean, you were talking about the tunnels and then flying cars. Do you really think that’s going to be real 

ELON MUSK:
It’s too noisy, and there’s too much airflow. So, the final issue with flying cars   I mean, if you get one of those toy drones, think of how much   how loud those are, and how much air they blow. Now imagine if that’s like 1,000 times heavier. It’s not going to make your neighbors happy. Your neighbors are not going to be happy if you land a flying car in your backyard.

JOE ROGAN:
It would be very helicopter-like.

ELON MUSK:
Or on your roof. They’re just really going to be like, “What the hell  That was annoying.”

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
You can’t even   If you want a flying car, just put some wheels on a helicopter.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there a way around that  Like, what if they figure out some sort of magnetic technology, like all those Bob Lazar type characters were thinking, that was a part of the UFO technology they were doing at Area 51  Remember, didn’t they have some thoughts about magnetics 

ELON MUSK:
Nope.

JOE ROGAN:
No, bullshit 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Really 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, there’s a fundamental momentum exchange with the air. So you must   You must accelerate   You have a mass and you have gravitational acceleration, and mass times   Your mass times gravity must equal the mass of airflow times the acceleration of that airflow, to have a neutral force.

JOE ROGAN:
So it’s impossible to get around-

ELON MUSK:
MG equals MA, and then you won’t move. But if MG is greater than MA, you will go down. And if MA is greater than MG, you will go up. That’s how it works.

JOE ROGAN:
There’s just no way around that 

ELON MUSK:
There is definitely no way around it.

JOE ROGAN:
There’s no way to create some sort of a magnetic something or another, that allows you to float 

ELON MUSK:
Technically, yes. You could have a strong enough magnet, but that magnet would be so strong that you would create a lot of trouble.

JOE ROGAN:
It would just suck cars up into your car  Just pick up axles and shit-

ELON MUSK:
I mean, you’d have to repel off of either a material on the ground or in a really nutty situation, off of Earth’s gravitational field, and somehow make that incredibly light. But that magnet would cause so much destruction, you’d be better off with a helicopter.

JOE ROGAN:
So, if there was some sort of magnet road, like you have two magnets, and they repel each other   If you had some sort of a magnet road that was below you, and you could travel on that magnet road, that would work 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Yes, you could have a magnet road.

JOE ROGAN:
A magnet road. Is that too ridiculous 

ELON MUSK:
No, it would work-

JOE ROGAN:
Cement’s pretty ridiculous too, right 

ELON MUSK:
You could do that. I would not recommend it.

JOE ROGAN:
There’s a lot of things I don’t recommend. I don’t recommend smoking.

ELON MUSK:
I would super not recommend that. Not wise, I think.

JOE ROGAN:
No 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Magnet roads 

ELON MUSK:
No. No. No, definitely not. Definitely not. That would cause a lot of trouble.

JOE ROGAN:
So you’ve put some time and consideration into this other than   You know, instead of   Like, my foolishly rendered thoughts. So you think that tunnels are the way to do it 

ELON MUSK:
Oh, it’ll work for sure.

JOE ROGAN:
That’ll work 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And these tunnels that you’re building right now, these are basically just like test versions of this ultimate idea that you have 

ELON MUSK:
You know, it’s just a hole in the ground.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. We played videos of it, where the idea is that-

ELON MUSK:
It’s just a hole in the ground.

JOE ROGAN:
  you’re going to drop that hole in the ground. There’s a sled on it, and the sled goes very fast, like 100 miles an hour plus 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, you can go real fast. You can go fast as you want. And then if you want to go long distances, you can just draw the air out of the tunnel, make sure it’s real straight.

JOE ROGAN:
Draw the air out of the tunnel 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, so a vacuum tunnel, because the   And then, depending on how fast you want to go, you could either use wheels or you could use air bearings, depending upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel, or you could maglev it, if you want to go super fast.

JOE ROGAN:
So a magnet road 

ELON MUSK:
Yes, but underground magnet roads-

JOE ROGAN:
Underground magnet road.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, otherwise you’re going to really create a lot of trouble, because there’s metal things.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, so magnet roads is the way to go, just underground.

ELON MUSK:
If you want to go really fast underground, you would be maglev in a vacuum tunnel.

JOE ROGAN:
Mag in a vacuum tunnel-

ELON MUSK:
Magnetic levitation in a in a vacuum tunnel-

JOE ROGAN:
  with rocket launchers.

ELON MUSK:
Pardon 

JOE ROGAN:
With rocket launchers.

ELON MUSK:
No, I would not recommend putting any-

JOE ROGAN:
Come on, bro.

ELON MUSK:
  exhaust gas in the tunnel.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, okay. I see what you’re saying, because then the air-

ELON MUSK:
Because then you’d have to pump it out.

JOE ROGAN:
  will be gone. Right, you’ll have to pump it out, and you probably have a limited amount of air in the first place. Like, how much can you breathe  Do you have to pump oxygen into these cubicles, or these tubes 

ELON MUSK:
No, you’d have like a pressurized pod. It’d be like a little tiny, underground spaceship, basically.

JOE ROGAN:
Like an airplane. Because you have air in the airplane. It’s not getting new air in.

ELON MUSK:
It is.

JOE ROGAN:
It is 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
They have like a little hole 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, they have a pump.

JOE ROGAN:
Really 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
So it gets it from the outside 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Wow. I didn’t know that.

ELON MUSK:
Airplanes have it easy, because essentially, they’re pretty leaky, but-

JOE ROGAN:
Jesus.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, but as long as the air pump is working at a decent speed   They have backup pumps.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh.

ELON MUSK:
They’ll have like three pumps, or four pumps, or something, and then that   Then it exhausts through the outflow valve, and in through whatever seals are not sealing quite right. Usually the door doesn’t seal quite right on a plane, so there’s a bit of leakage around the door, but the pumps exceed the outflow rate, and then that sets the pressure in the cabin.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, have you ever looked at planes and gone, “I could fix this. I just don’t have the time.”

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Too busy making-

ELON MUSK:
I have a design for a plane.

JOE ROGAN:
You do 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
A better design 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, probably. I think it is, yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Who have you talked to about this 

ELON MUSK:
I’ve talked to friends.

JOE ROGAN:
Friends 

ELON MUSK:
Friends, and-

JOE ROGAN:
I’m your friend.

ELON MUSK:
  girlfriends, and-

JOE ROGAN:
You could tell me. What do you got  What’s going on 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean the exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric, vertical takeoff and landing, supersonic jet of some kind.

JOE ROGAN:
Vertical takeoff and landing meaning no need for a runway, just shoot up straight in the air, and  

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Ooh. How would you do that  I mean, they do that on some military aircraft, correct 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. The trick is that you have to transition to level flight, and then you   The thing that you would use for vertical takeoff and landing is not suitable for high speed flight.

JOE ROGAN:
So you have two different systems  Vertical takeoff-

ELON MUSK:
I’ve thought about this quite a lot.

JOE ROGAN:
  and landing system-

ELON MUSK:
I’ve thought about this quite a lot.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
The interesting thing about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack, because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. Once you’ve overcome gravitational potential energy and you’re at a high altitude, the energy you use in cruise is very low, and then you can recapture a large part of the gravitational potential energy on the way down. So you really don’t need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy.

ELON MUSK:
So, once you can get high   Like, the way to think about a plane is it’s a force balance. So it’s a force balance. So, a plane that is not accelerating is a neutral force balance. You have the force of gravity, you have the lift force of the wings, then you’ve got the force of the whatever thrusting device, the propeller, or turbine, or whatever it is, and you’ve got the resistance force of the air.

ELON MUSK:
Now, the higher you go, the lower the air resistance is. Air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square, and exponential beats a square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy, and at a certain altitude, you can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile, than an aircraft at 35,000 feet, because it’s just a force balance.

JOE ROGAN:
I’m too stupid for this conversation.

ELON MUSK:
It makes sense, though.

JOE ROGAN:
No, I’m sure it does. Now, when you think about this new idea of designing   When you have this idea about improving planes, are you going to bring this to somebody  Are you just   Chuck this around 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I have a lot on my plate.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. That’s what I’m saying. I don’t know how you do what you do now, but if you keep coming up with these   But it’s got to be hard to pawn these off on someone else either, like, “Hey, go do a good job with this vertical takeoff and landing system that I want to implement to regular planes.”

ELON MUSK:
The electric airplane isn’t necessary right now. Electric cars are important.

JOE ROGAN:
We need some sort of-

ELON MUSK:
Solar energy is important. Stationary storage of energy is important. These things are much more important than creating electric supersonic VTOL. Also, the planes naturally   You really want that gravitational energy density for an aircraft, and this is improving over time. So, you know, it’s important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. That’s why electric cars   It matters whether electric cars happen sooner or later.

ELON MUSK:
You know, we’re really playing a crazy game here with the atmosphere and the oceans. We’re taking vast amount of carbon from deep underground and putting this in the atmosphere. This is crazy. We should not do this. It’s very dangerous. So we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I mean, the bizarre thing is that obviously, we’re going to run out of oil in the long term. You know, there’s only so much oil we can mine and burn. It’s tautological. We must have a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term. So we know that’s the endpoint.

ELON MUSK:
We know that. So why run this crazy experiment, where we take trillions of tons of carbon from underground, and put it in the atmosphere and oceans  This is an insane experiment. It’s the dumbest experiment in human history. Why are we doing this  It’s crazy.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think this is a product of momentum, that we started off doing this when it was just a few engines, a few hundred million gallons of fuel over the whole world, not that big of a deal, and then slowly but surely, over a century, it got out of control, and now it’s not just our fuel, but it’s also   I mean, fossil fuels are involved in so many different electronics, so many different items that people die. There’s just this constant desire for fossil fuels, constant need for oil, without consideration of the sustainability.

ELON MUSK:
You know, the thing is, like oil, oil, coal, gas, that’s the easy money. It’s the easy money.

JOE ROGAN:
Have you heard about clean coal  The president’s been tweeting about it. It’s got to be real. Clean coal, all caps. Did you see  He used all caps. Clean coal.

ELON MUSK:
Well, you know, it’s very difficult to put that CO2 back in the ground. It doesn’t like being in solid form, takes a lot of energy-

JOE ROGAN:
Have you thought about something like that  Like, some sort of a filter, giant building-sized filter, sucks carbon out of the atmosphere  Is that possible 

ELON MUSK:
No, it’s not possible.

JOE ROGAN:
No 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
No.

ELON MUSK:
Nope, definitely not.

JOE ROGAN:
So we’re fucked.

ELON MUSK:
No, we’re not fucked. I mean, this is quite a complex question. You know, we’re really just   The more carbon we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphere, and a lot of it gets permeated into the oceans, the more dangerous it is. Like, I don’t think right now   I think we’re okay right now. We can probably even add some more, but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow. Like, there’s a vast base of industry, vast transportation system   Like, there’s two-and-a-half billion cars and trucks in the world. And the new car and truck production, if it was 100% electric, that’s only about 100 million per year, so it would take   If you could snap your fingers and instantly turn all cars and trucks electric, it would still take 25 years to change the transport base to electric. Makes sense, because how long does a car or truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed  About 20 to 25 years.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there a way to accelerate that process, like some sort of subsidies, or some encouragement from the government, financially 

ELON MUSK:
Well, the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any oil-burning device, any power plant or car, is fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere. I’ll just say atmosphere for shirt. So, you can say like, “Okay, there’s a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere,” so there’s some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon in the atmosphere, things overheat, oceans warm up, ice caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, you know, everything’s under water.

ELON MUSK:
But it’s not clear what that number is, but it’s definitely   The scientists would all   It’s really quite   The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Overwhelming. I mean, I don’t know any serious scientist, actually zero, literally zero, who don’t think that we have quite a serious climate risk that we’re facing. So, there’s fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing, power plants, aircraft, car, frankly even rockets. I mean, rockets use a   They burn fuel, but with rockets, there’s just no other way to get to orbit, unfortunately, so it’s the only way.

ELON MUSK:
But with cars, there’s definitely a better way, with electric cars, and to generate the issue, do so with photovoltaics, because we’ve got a giant thermonuclear reactor in the sky, called the sun. It’s great. It sort of shows up every day, very reliable. So if you can generate energy from solar panels, store it with batteries, you could have energy 24 hours a day. And then you can send it to the poles, or near, to the north, with high voltage lines. Also, northern parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydro power as well.

ELON MUSK:
Anyway, all fossil fuel powered things have an inherent subsidy, which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere, and oceans. So, people tend to think like, “Why should electric vehicles have a subsidy ” But they’re not taking into account that all fossil fuel burning vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the environmental cost to Earth. But nobody’s paying for it. We are going to pay for it, obviously. In the future, we will pay for it. It’s just not paid for now.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, what is the bottleneck in regards to electric cars, and trucks, and things like that  Is it battery capacity 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, we’ve got to scale up production, got to make the car compelling, make it better than gasoline or diesel cars.

JOE ROGAN:
Make it more efficient in terms of like the distance it can travel without refueling.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, got to be able to go far enough, recharge fast-

JOE ROGAN:
And your Roadster, you’re anticipating 600 miles  Is that correct 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Yeah, we-

JOE ROGAN:
What does that-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, 600 mile range.

JOE ROGAN:
Is that right now  Like, have you driven one 600 miles now 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, we could totally make one right now that would do 600 miles, but the thing is, it’s too expensive. Like, the car’s got to-

JOE ROGAN:
How much more so 

ELON MUSK:
Well, you know, it’ll just have a 200 kilowatt hour battery pack, and you can go 600 miles, as long as-

JOE ROGAN:
Like, versus what do you have now 

ELON MUSK:
330 mile range, but that’s plenty for most people.

JOE ROGAN:
330 mile range, and what is that in terms of kilowatts 

ELON MUSK:
Well, that would be for a Model S, 100 kilowatt hour pack will do about 330 miles, maybe 335. Some people have hyper-miled it to 500 miles.

JOE ROGAN:
Hyper-miled it  What does that mean 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, just like go-

JOE ROGAN:
45 miles an hour or something 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, like 30 miles an hour or something. It’s like on level ground, with you pump the tires up really well and go on a smooth surface, and you can go for a long time. But you could definitely comfortably do 300 miles.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there-

ELON MUSK:
This is fine for most people. Usually, 200 or 250 miles is fine. 300 miles is you don’t even think about it, really.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there any possibility that you could use solar power, that solar powered, one day   Especially in Los Angeles. I mean, as you said about that giant nuclear reactor a million times bigger than Earth just floating in the sky, is it possible that one day, you’ll be able to just power all these cars, just on solar power  I mean, we don’t ever have cloudy days. If we do, there’s three of them.

ELON MUSK:
Well, the surface area of a car is   Without making the car really blocky, or having some-

JOE ROGAN:
Like a G-Wagon 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, and just like having a lot of surface area, where maybe solar panels fold out or something-

JOE ROGAN:
Like your E Class. That’s what we need-

ELON MUSK:
The E-Type 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, the Jaguar E-Type, with the giant long hood. That could be a giant solar panel.

ELON MUSK:
Well, at the beginning of Tesla, I did want to have this unfolding solar panel thing, that you’d press a button and it’d just unfold these solar panels and recharge your car in the parking lot.

JOE ROGAN:
Ah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, we could do that, but I think it’s probably better to just put that on your roof.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
And then it’s going to just be facing the sun all the time, because like-

JOE ROGAN:
What car had that on the roof 

ELON MUSK:
Otherwise, your car could be in the shade. You know, it could be in the shade, could be in a garage, or something like that.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Didn’t a Fisker have that on the roof  The Fisker Karma new generation for   I believe it was only for the radio  Was that correct 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, I think it could recharge like two miles a day or something like-

JOE ROGAN:
Did you laugh when they started blowing up when they got hit with water  Do you remember what happened 

ELON MUSK:
They got   What 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, they had a dealership, or-

ELON MUSK:
Oh, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
The Fisker Karmas were parked-

ELON MUSK:
Was that like with the flood in Jersey 

JOE ROGAN:
Yes, yes. When the hurricane came in, they got overwhelmed with water and they all started exploding. There’s fucking great video of it. Did you watch the video 

ELON MUSK:
I didn’t watch the video, but I did see-

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, if I was you-

ELON MUSK:
I saw a picture of the aftermath.

JOE ROGAN:
  I would be naked, lubed up, watch that video, laughing my ass off. They all blow up. They got wet and they blew up. That’s not good.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, we made our battery waterproof so that doesn’t happen.

JOE ROGAN:
Smart move.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, there’s a guy in Kazakhstan, that   I think it was Kazakhstan, that he just boated through a tunnel, underwater tunnel, like a flooded tunnel, and just turned the wheels to steer, and pressed the accelerator, and it just floated through the tunnel, and he steered around the other cars. Like-

JOE ROGAN:
That’s amazing.

ELON MUSK:
It’s on the internet.

JOE ROGAN:
What happens if your car gets a little sideways  Like, if you were driving in snow. Like, what if your autopilot is on and you’re in like Denver, and it snows out, and your car gets a little sideways  Does it correct itself 

ELON MUSK:
Oh, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Does it know how to-

ELON MUSK:
It’s got great traction control.

JOE ROGAN:
But does it know how to, like, correct 

ELON MUSK:
Oh, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you know how like when your ass-end kicks out-

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
  you know how to counter-steer 

ELON MUSK:
Oh, yeah. No, it’s really good.

JOE ROGAN:
It knows how to do it 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa.

ELON MUSK:
It’s pretty crazy.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s pretty crazy.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
So like if you’re going sideways, it knows how to correct itself 

ELON MUSK:
It generally won’t go sideways.

JOE ROGAN:
It won’t 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Why not 

ELON MUSK:
It will correct itself before it goes sideways.

JOE ROGAN:
Even in black ice 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, there’s videos where you could see the car be-

JOE ROGAN:
That alone.

ELON MUSK:
Traction control system is very good. It makes you feel like superman. It’s great. You feel like you can   It will make you feel like this incredible driver.

JOE ROGAN:
I believe it.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Now how do you program that 

ELON MUSK:
We do our testing on like an ice like in Sweden.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, really 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, in like Norway, and Canada, and a few other places.

JOE ROGAN:
Porsche does a lot of that too.

ELON MUSK:
New Zealand as well.

JOE ROGAN:
They do a lot of their   They do some of their driver training school on these frozen surfaces, so you’re just   The car’s going sideways whether you like it or not, and you have to learn how to slide into corners, and how to adjust.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Well, electric cars have really great traction control, because the reaction time is so fast. So, with a gasoline car, you’ve got a lot of latency. It takes a while for the engine to react and for the   But for electric motors, incredibly precise. That’s why you can imagine   Like, if you had a printer or something, you wouldn’t have a gasoline engine printer. That would be pretty weird, or like a surgical device. It’s going to be an electric motor on the surgical device, on the printer. Gasoline engine’s going to be just chugging away. It’s not going to have the reaction time.

ELON MUSK:
But to an electric motor, it’s operating at the millisecond level, so it can turn on and off traction, within like inches of getting on the   Like, let’s say drive over a patch of ice. It’ll turn traction off and then turn it on a couple of inches, right after the ice. Like, with a little patch of ice, because in the frame of the electric motor, you’re moving incredibly slowly. You’re a snail. You’re just moving so slowly, because it can see at 1,000 frames a second. So it’s like say one Mississippi. It just thought about things 1,000 times.

JOE ROGAN:
So it’s realized that your wheels are not getting traction, it understands there’s some slippery surface that you’re driving on, and it makes adjustments in real time.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. In milliseconds.

JOE ROGAN:
That would be so much safer than a regular car.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, it is.

JOE ROGAN:
Just that alone, for loved ones, you’d want them to be driving your car.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, the-

JOE ROGAN:
I’m on board. Fuck motors. Dude, fuck regular motors.

ELON MUSK:
The S, X, and 3 have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the US government.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, but it’s pretty crazy. You know, people still sue us. Like, they’ll have some accident at 60 miles an hour, where they just twisted an ankle, and they sue   Like, they would be dead in another car. They still sue us.

JOE ROGAN:
But that’s to be expected, isn’t it 

ELON MUSK:
I guess to be expected.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you take that into account with like the same sort of fatalistic undertones, just sort of go, “Eh, you got to just let it go. This is what people do.”

ELON MUSK:
I’ll tell you, I’ve got a-

JOE ROGAN:
It is what it is.

ELON MUSK:
  quite a lot of respect for the justice system. Judges are very smart, and they see   So far, I’ve found judges to be very good at justice, because like, what   And juries are good too. Like, they’re actually quite good. You know, people   You know, you read about occasional errors in the justice system. Let me tell you, most of the time, they’re very good.

JOE ROGAN:
I think-

ELON MUSK:
And you know, the guy I mentioned, that fell asleep in the car, and he road over a cyclist, and that was what encouraged me to get autopilot out as soon as possible, that guy sued us.

JOE ROGAN:
He sued you, for falling asleep 

ELON MUSK:
Yes, he   I’m not kidding. He blamed it on the new car smell.

JOE ROGAN:
What 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
He blamed him falling asleep on your new car smell. There’s somewhere there’s a lawyer-

ELON MUSK:
This is a real thing that happened.

JOE ROGAN:
Somewhere there’s a lawyer that thought that through in front of his laptop before he wrote that up.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. He got a lawyer, and he sued us, and the judge was like, “This is crazy. Stop bothering me. No.”

JOE ROGAN:
Thank god.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Thank god. Thank god there’s a judge out there with a brain.

ELON MUSK:
I’ll tell you, judges are very good.

JOE ROGAN:
Some of them. What about that judge that sent those boys up the river in Pennsylvania, who was selling those kids out  You know about that story 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, judge was selling young boys to prisons. He was-

ELON MUSK:
What 

JOE ROGAN:
Like literally, yeah. Literally under bribes for   He was-

ELON MUSK:
Was this an elected judge or-

JOE ROGAN:
He was-

ELON MUSK:
Because some places, you have a judge that’s actually a politician.

JOE ROGAN:
No, he was an elected judge. This is a very famous story. He-

 

JOE ROGAN:
No. He was an elected judge. This is a very famous story.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
He’s in jail right now, I think for the rest of his life. And he put away   He would take a young boy would so something like steal something from a store and he would put them in detention for five years. Something ridiculously egregious. And they investigated his history and they found out that he was literally being paid off. Was it by private prisons  Is that what the deal was  There was some sort of   But anyway, this judge is-

JOE ROGAN:
Two judges.

JOE ROGAN:
Two judges 

JOE ROGAN:
Two judges. Kids for cash scandal is what it’s called. 2008, yeah. Common please judges, so I think they are elected.

JOE ROGAN:
And who was paying them 

JOE ROGAN:
Oh  

JOE ROGAN:
Someone   It was proven to the point where they’re in jail now.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
That someone was paying them to put more asses in the seats in these private prisons.

JOE ROGAN:
A million dollar payment to put them in the youth centers builder  -

JOE ROGAN:
A million dollar payment 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
I do think it’s this private prisons’ thing is creating a bad incentive.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s dark. Right.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, but that judge is in prison.

JOE ROGAN:
Thank God.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, but for people who think perhaps the justice system consists entirely of judges like that, I want to assure you this is not the case. The vast majority of judges are very good.

JOE ROGAN:
I agree.

ELON MUSK:
And they care about justice, and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to be a trial lawyer, and instead they cared about justice and they made less money because they care about justice. And that’s why they’re judges.

JOE ROGAN:
I feel that same way about police officers.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
I feel like there’s so many interactions with so many different people with police officers that the very few that stand out that are horrific, we tend to look at that like this is evidence that police are all corrupt, and I think that’s crazy.

ELON MUSK:
Most police are very honest.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
And military personnel that I know are very honorable, ethical people and much more honorable and ethical than the average person. That’s my impression.

JOE ROGAN:
I agree. That is my impression as well.

ELON MUSK:
And that’s not to suggest we be complacent and assume everyone’s honest and ethical. And obviously if somebody is given a trusted place in society such as being a police officer or a judge and they are corrupt then we must be extra vigilant against such situations, and take action. But we should not think that this is somehow broadly descriptive of people in that profession.

JOE ROGAN:
I could agree more. I think there’s also an issue with one of the things that happens with police officers, prosecutors, and anyone that’s trying to convict someone or arrest someone is that it becomes a game, an end game people want to win. And sometimes people cheat.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Yes. If you’re a prosecutor you should not always want to win. There are times when you should like okay, I just should not want to win this case and then just pass on that case. Sometimes people want to win too much, that is true. I think also it becomes tough. If you’re a district attorney you tend to see a lot of criminals, and then your view of the world can get negatively   have a negative   you can have a negative view of the world because you’re just interacting with a lot of criminals. But actually most of society does not consist of criminals. And I actually had this conversation at dinner several years ago with a district attorney. I was like, “Man, it must sometimes seem pretty dark because, man, there’s some terrible human beings out there.” And he was like, “Yep.” He was dealing with some case which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would run people over somehow for insurance money. And it was rough. I was like, “Wow, that’s pretty rough.”

ELON MUSK:
It’s hard to maintain faith in humanity if you’re a district attorney, but you know, it’s only a few percent of society that are actually bad. And then if you go to the worst .1% of society, or the worst one in 1,000 to one in one million   How bad is the millionth worst person in the United States  Pretty damn bad, damn evil. The millionth   One in one million of evil is so evil people could not even conceive of it. But there’s 330 million in the United States, so that’s 330 people out there somewhere. By the same token, there’s also 330 who are incredible angels and unbelievable good human beings.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
On the other side.

JOE ROGAN:
But because of our fear of danger, we tend to   our thought tend to gravitate towards the worst case scenario.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And we want to frame that. And it’s one of the real problem with prejudice, whether it’s prejudice towards different minorities or prejudice towards police officers, or anything, we want to look at the worse case scenario and say, “This is an example of what this is all about.” And you see that even with people who the frame genders. Some men frame women like that. They get ripped of by a few women and they decide all women are evil. Some women get fucked over by a few men, all men are shit. And this is very toxic.

ELON MUSK:
It is.

JOE ROGAN:
And it’s also a very unbalanced way to viewing the world and it’s very emotionally based, and it’s based on your own experience, your own anecdotal experience. And it can be very influential to the people around you, and it’s just a dangerous way   it’s a dangerous thought process and pattern to promote.

ELON MUSK:
It is. It is a very dangerous pattern. I really think people should give other people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they’re good until proven otherwise. And I think really, most people are actually pretty good people. Nobody’s perfect.

JOE ROGAN:
They have to be. If you think the vast numbers of us that are just interacting with each other constantly, we have to be better than we think we are.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, I  

JOE ROGAN:
There’s no other way.

ELON MUSK:
Here are all these weapons, but how many times   Nobody’s presumably tried to murder you in your  -

JOE ROGAN:
Nobody yet.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, nobody’s put this rifle  . The swords right there.

JOE ROGAN:
Now there’s fucking fake flame thrower here, not a flame thrower. Now we’ve got a real problem. I’m going to put it on that side, too. I’m going to leave it for the guests. I’m like, look man, if I say something that fucked up it’s right there.

ELON MUSK:
It’ll liven things up for sure. It guaranteed to make any party better.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Well, that’s the armed civilization theory that an armed community is a safe and polite community. You ever been in Texas  It’s kind of true.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
People in Texas are super polite and everyone’s got a gun.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Don’t make somebody angry. Don’t know what’s going to happen.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it’s not a good move. Piss people off and everybody can have a gun. You’re better off to just let that guy get in your lane.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. yeah. We got a big test site in central Texas.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, yeah 

ELON MUSK:
In Waco.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, beautiful.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, SpaceX in McGregor. It’s about 15 minutes away from Waco.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s close to where Ted Nugent lives.

ELON MUSK:
It is 

JOE ROGAN:
Shout out to Ted Nugent.

ELON MUSK:
Okay, cool. Yeah, we have lots of fire and loud explosions and things.

JOE ROGAN:
I bet.

ELON MUSK:
And people, they’re cool with it.

JOE ROGAN:
They don’t give a fuck out there.

ELON MUSK:
They are very supportive.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, you can buy fireworks where your kids go to school.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It’s dangerous.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, but it’s free.

ELON MUSK:
It’s free.

JOE ROGAN:
There’s something about   Texas that’s very enticing because of that. It is dangerous, but it’s also free.

ELON MUSK:
Right. Yeah, I like Texas actually.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, I prefer it over places that are more restrictive, but more liberal because you could always be liberal. Just because things are free and just because you have a certain amount of right wing type characters it doesn’t mean you have to be that way.

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
And honestly, there’s a lot of those people that are pretty fucking open minded and let you do whatever you want to do.

ELON MUSK:
Right.

JOE ROGAN:
As long as you don’t bother them.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s my whole   Right now with the way we’re able to communicate with each other today and how radically different it is than generations past is that we all just   the dust settles and we all realize, like what you were saying that most people are good.

ELON MUSK:
Most people are good.

JOE ROGAN:
The vast majority.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I think you should give people the benefit of the doubt for sure.

JOE ROGAN:
I think you’re right. You know what could help that  Mushrooms.

ELON MUSK:
Mushrooms.

JOE ROGAN:
Don’t you think 

ELON MUSK:
They’re delicious.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, right. They’re good for you, too. All of them. All kinds of them. What do you see in terms of when you think about the future of your companies, what do you see as bottle necks  Want some more of these 

ELON MUSK:
Sure. Thank you.

JOE ROGAN:
What do you see in terms of bottle necks of things that are holding back innovation  Is it regulatory commissions and people that don’t understand the technology that are influencing policy  What could potentially be holding you guys back right now  Is there anything that you would change 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. That’s a good question. I wish politicians were better at science. That would help a lot.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s a problem.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
There’s no incentive for them to be good at science.

ELON MUSK:
There isn’t. Actually, they’re pretty good at science in China, I have to say.

JOE ROGAN:
Are they 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. The mayor of Beijing has, I believe, an environmental engineering degree, and the deputy major has a physics degree. I met them. Shanghai is really smart.

JOE ROGAN:
You’re up on technology. What do you think about this government policy of stopping use of Wall Way phones and there something about the worry about spying. From what I understand from real tech people, they think it’s horse shit. Like phones.

ELON MUSK:
I don’t know. I don’t know.

JOE ROGAN:
The government said don’t buy Wall Way phones. Are you up on that at all  No  Should we just abandon this idea 

ELON MUSK:
I guess if you have top secret stuff then you want to be pretty careful about what hardware you use, but most people do not have top secret stuff. Nobody really cares what porn you watch. Nobody actually cares.

JOE ROGAN:
And if they that’s on them.

ELON MUSK:
National spy agencies do not care, do not give a rat’s ass what porn you watch. They do not care. So, what secrets does a national spy agency gave to learn from the average citizen  Nothing.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s the argument against the narrative and the argument by a lot of these tech people is that the real concern is that these companies like Wall Way are innovating at a radical pace. And they’re trying to stop them from integrating into our culture and letting this   Right now they’re the number two cell phone manufacturer in the world. Samsung’s number one, Wall Way’s number two, Apple is now number three. They surpassed Apple as number two. And the idea is that this is all taking place without them having any foothold whatsoever in American. There’s no carriers that have their phones. You have to buy their phones unlocked through some third party, and then put   The worry is that these are somehow or another controlled by the Chinese government. The Communist Chinese government is going to distribute these phones. And I don’t know if it’s the worry is economic influence, or that they’re have too much power. I don’t know what it is. Are you paying attention at all at any of this 

ELON MUSK:
Not really.

JOE ROGAN:
No.

ELON MUSK:
I don’t think we should worry too much about Wall Way phones. Maybe our national security agencies shouldn’t have Wall Way phones. Maybe that’s a question mark, but I think for the average citizen it doesn’t matter. Pretty sure the Chinese government does not care about the goings on of the average American citizen.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there a time where you think that there will be no security  Will be impossible to hold back information  That whatever bottleneck will let go. We’re going to give in. That whatever bottleneck between privacy and ultimate innovation will have to be bridged in order for us to achieve the next level of technological proficiency that we’re just going to abandon it. And they’ll be no security. No privacy.

ELON MUSK:
Do people want privacy  ‘Cause they seem to put everything on the internet-

JOE ROGAN:
Well, right now-

ELON MUSK:
  practically.

JOE ROGAN:
  they’re confused, but when you’re talking about your neuro link and this idea that one day we are going to be able to share information, we’re going to be some sort of a thing that’s symbiotically connected.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I think we really need to worry about security in that situation for sure.

JOE ROGAN:
And when-

ELON MUSK:
That’s a security paramount.

JOE ROGAN:
Sure. But also what we will be is we’ll be so much different. Our concerns about money, about status, about   All these things will seemingly go by the wayside if we really become enlightened. If we really become artificially enlightened by some an AI interface where we have this symbiotic relationship with some new internet type connection to information what happens then  What is important and what is not important  Is privacy important when we’re all gods 

ELON MUSK:
I think with things that we think are important to keep private right now we probably will not think are important-

JOE ROGAN:
Shame, right  Information, right  What are you hiding  Emotions  What are we hiding 

ELON MUSK:
I think   I don’t know. Maybe it’s embarrassing stuff.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, embarrassing stuff.

ELON MUSK:
But there’s actually   I think people   There’s not that much that’s kept private that is actually relevant that other people would actually care about. You think other people care about it, but they don’t really care about it, and certainly governments don’t.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, some people care about it, but then it gets weird when it gets exposed. Like Jennifer Lawrence when those naked pictures of her got exposed. I think in some ways people liked her more.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
They realized well, she’s just a person that’s just a girl who likes sex, and is just alive and has a boyfriend, and sends him messages, and now you get to look into it. You probably shouldn’t have, but somebody let it go, and they put it online. and they’re, “All right.”

ELON MUSK:
She seems to be doing okay.

JOE ROGAN:
She’s a person. She’s just you, and me, and it’s the same thing. She’s just in some weird place where she’s on a 35 foot tall screen with music playing every time she talks.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I’m sure she’s not happy about-

JOE ROGAN:
No, she’s fine.

ELON MUSK:
  it.

JOE ROGAN:
No.

ELON MUSK:
But she’s clearly doing fine.

JOE ROGAN:
But once this interface is fully realized where we really do become something far more powerful in terms of our cognitive ability, or our ability to understand irrational thoughts and mitigate them, and that we’re all connected in some insane way, what are our thoughts on wealth, our thoughts on social status  How many of those just evaporate in our need for privacy  Maybe our need for privacy will be the ultimate bottleneck that we’ll have to surpass.

ELON MUSK:
I think the things that we think are important now will probably not be important in the future. But there will be things that are important, there just are different things.

JOE ROGAN:
What would be more important 

ELON MUSK:
There might be some of ideas potentially. I don’t think Darwin’s going away.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Darwin’s going to be there. Darwin will be there forever.

JOE ROGAN:
Forever, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
It would just be a different arena. A different arena.

JOE ROGAN:
A digital arena.

ELON MUSK:
Different arena. Darwin’s not going away.

JOE ROGAN:
What keep you up at night 

ELON MUSK:
Well, it’s quite hard to run companies, especially car companies, I should say. It’s quite challenging.

JOE ROGAN:
The car business is the hardest one of all the things you do 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Because it’s a consumer oriented business as opposed to SpaceX 

ELON MUSK:
Not that SpaceX   SpaceX is no walk in the park, but a car company, it’s very difficult to keep a car company alive. It’s very difficult. There’s only two car companies in the history of American car companies that haven’t gone bankrupt and that’s Ford and Tesla. That’s it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, Ford rode out that crazy storm, huh  They’re the only ones.

ELON MUSK:
By the skin of their teeth.

JOE ROGAN:
Shout out to the mustang. Yeah, by the skin of their teeth. That is interesting, right 

ELON MUSK:
Same with Tesla. We barely survived.

JOE ROGAN:
How close did you get to folding 

ELON MUSK:
Very close. We   2008 is not a good a time to be a car company, especially a startup car company, and especially an electric car company. That was stupidity squared.

JOE ROGAN:
And this is when you had those cool roadsters with the T-top.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
With the target top 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. We had   It was a highly modified   Chasity. The body was all completely different. By the way, it was super dumb strategy that we actually did because we-

JOE ROGAN:
Why was it dumb 

ELON MUSK:
It was based on two false premises. One false premise was that’s we’d be able to cheaply convert the lotus least and use that as a car platform, and that we would be able to use technology from this little company called AC Propulsion for the electric drive train and battery. As the AC Propulsion technology did not work in production and we ended up using none of it in the long term, none of it. We had to redesign everything. And then once you add a battery pack and an electric motor, so car got heavier. It got 30% heavier, invalidated the entire structure, all the crash structure. Everything had to be redone. I think it had less than 7% of the parts were common with any other device including cars or anything.

JOE ROGAN:
Less than 7% 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Everything  Including tires and wheels  Bolts  Breaks 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, even every-

JOE ROGAN:
Steering wheel  The seat 

ELON MUSK:
The steering wheel was   I think the steering wheel was almost the same. Yes, the wind screen, wind screen.

JOE ROGAN:
Different 

ELON MUSK:
No, I think the windscreen was the same.

JOE ROGAN:
Same 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I think we were able to keep the wind screen.

JOE ROGAN:
Less than 7%, so that’s basically-

ELON MUSK:
Every body panel was different. The entire structure was different. We couldn’t use the HVAC system, the air conditioner. It was a belt driven air conditioner.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, right.

ELON MUSK:
So, now we needed something that was electrically driven. We needed a new AC compressor.

JOE ROGAN:
And all that takes away from the battery life as well right 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. We needed a small, highly efficient air conditioning system that fit in a tiny car, and was electrically powered and not belt driven. It was very difficult.

JOE ROGAN:
How much did those weigh  Those cars  The roadster 

ELON MUSK:
I think it was about 2,700 pounds.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s still very light.

ELON MUSK:
27   It depends on which version. 2,650 to 2,750 pounds. Something like that.

JOE ROGAN:
And what was the weight distribution 

ELON MUSK:
It was about   Well, there were different versions of the car, so it was about 55 on the rear because it was-

JOE ROGAN:
That’s not bad.

ELON MUSK:
  rear bias.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, but not bad considering a 911, which is one of the most popular sports cars of all time. Heavy rear end bias.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. The 911, lack of a joke, is like the   despite Newton not being on their side. If you’re fighting Newton it’s very difficult.

JOE ROGAN:
Well-

ELON MUSK:
You’ve got this   The moments of inertia on a 911 don’t make any sense.

JOE ROGAN:
They do once you understand them. Once you understand them-

ELON MUSK:
You don’t want to hang the engine off the ass because it is not a wise move.

JOE ROGAN:
You don’t want to let up on the gas when you’re in a corner.

ELON MUSK:
The problem with something that’s where the engine is mounted over the rear axil or off the rear axil towards the rear it that your pulling amount of inertia is fundamentally screwed. You cannot solve this. It’s unsolvable. You’re screwed. Pulled amount of inertia is you’re screwed. R

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Seriously, if you spun the car like a top that’s your   moment of inertia. You’re just   I promised I wouldn’t swear on this, by the way.

JOE ROGAN:
Really  To who 

ELON MUSK:
My friend.

JOE ROGAN:
Tell that friend to go fuck himself. Who told you not to swear 

ELON MUSK:
I friend.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s not a good friend.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.  

JOE ROGAN:
  realize you’re fucking Elon Musk. You can do whatever you want, man. If you ever get confused, call me.

ELON MUSK:
I’ll swear in private.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
Swear up a storm.

JOE ROGAN:
Just say frickin’. It’s a fun way, those old house moms, wives and shit that have children. “Oh, this frickin’ thing.”

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, but anyway the Porsche, it’s incredible how well Porsche has given that its physics, the moments of inertia aren’t so messed up to actually still make it work well is incredible.

JOE ROGAN:
If you know how to turn into the corner once you get used to the feeling of it there’s actual benefits to it. There are some benefits.

ELON MUSK:
I enjoy   The car I had before Tesla was a 911.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, okay.

ELON MUSK:
That was-

JOE ROGAN:
Nine nine seven or six 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Nine nine seven 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. That’s a great car, man.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Particularly on the Porsche when they had the variable vanes, the turbo, and it didn’t have the turbo lag, that was great. That was really great. The turbo lag is you floor it, phone home, call your mom.

JOE ROGAN:
The older ones, right 

ELON MUSK:
About an hour later the car accelerates.

JOE ROGAN:
And super dangerous, too, because then the wheels start spinning. Yeah. There’s something fun about it, though, feeling that rear weight kicking around. And again-

ELON MUSK:
It’s great.

JOE ROGAN:
  it’s not efficient.

ELON MUSK:
I had a good feel to it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I agree.

JOE ROGAN:
But that’s what I was talking about earlier about that little car that I have, the ’93 911. It’s not fast. It’s not the best handling car, but it’s more satisfying than any other car I have because it’s so mechanical. Everything about it crackles and bumps and it gives you all this feedback. I take it to the Comedy Store because when I get there I feel like my brain is just popping and it’s on fire. It’s like a strategy for me now that I really stopped driving other cars there. I drive that car there just for the brain juice. Just for the interaction.

ELON MUSK:
You should try Model S P100D.

JOE ROGAN:
I’ll try it.

ELON MUSK:
It’ll blow your mind.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
And your skull.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay. Tell me what to order, I’ll order it.

ELON MUSK:
Model S P100D.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay, Jamie, write it down.

ELON MUSK:
That’s the car that I drive.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay, okay. I’ll get with the car you drive. Okay.

ELON MUSK:
It will blow your mind out of your skull.

JOE ROGAN:
How far can I   I believe you. How car can I drive  How far can I go 

ELON MUSK:
About 300 miles.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s good. For L.A. regular days that’s good.

ELON MUSK:
You’ll never notice the battery.

JOE ROGAN:
Never 

ELON MUSK:
Never.

JOE ROGAN:
How hard is it to get one of the crazy plugs installed in your house  That difficult 

ELON MUSK:
No, it’s super easy. It’s like-

JOE ROGAN:
Didn’t you-

ELON MUSK:
  it’s like a dryer plug. It’s like a dryer outlet.

JOE ROGAN:
Didn’t you come up with some crazy tiles for your roof that are solar paneled 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Yeah, I have it on my roof right now, actually. I’m just trying it out. The thing, it takes a while to test roof stuff because roofs have to last a long time, so you want your roof to last at least 30 years.

JOE ROGAN:
Could you put it over a regular roof 

ELON MUSK:
No. So, there’s two versions. There’s the solar panels you put on a rood. It depends on whether your roof’s new or old. If your roof’s new you don’t want to replace the roof. You want to put solar panels on the roof, so that’s retro fit. And then we’re trying to make the retro fit panels look real nice. But then the new product we’re coming out with is if you have a roof that’s either your building a house or you’re going to replace a roof anyway then make the tiles have solar cells embedded in the tiles. It’s quite a tricky thing ’cause you want to not see the solar cell behind the glass tile, do you have to really work with the glass, and the various coatings, and layers so that you don’t see the solar cell behind the glass, otherwise it doesn’t look right. So, it’s really tricky-

JOE ROGAN:
There is it. Jamie put it up there.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Man, that looks good. Is there a-

ELON MUSK:
See, if you look closely you can   If you zoom in you can see the cell, but if you zoom out you don’t see the cell.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. Well, it looks cool though.

ELON MUSK:
See 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
That’s hard.

JOE ROGAN:
Invisible solar cell.

ELON MUSK:
It’s really hard because you have to have sunlight go through, but when it gets reflected back out it hides the fact that there’s a cell there.

JOE ROGAN:
Now are those available to the consumer right now 

ELON MUSK:
Well, we have a, I think-

JOE ROGAN:
Those on that roof right there 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s amazing. Oh, that looks good.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Ooh. I like that.

ELON MUSK:
That one’s hard.

JOE ROGAN:
So, you’ve got that fake Spanish looking thing.

ELON MUSK:
That’s French light.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s White people in Connecticut smoking pipes. Look at that one. That’s bad ass, dude.

ELON MUSK:
Those all actually work.

JOE ROGAN:
I believe you. So, the solar panels that are on that house that we just looked at, is that sufficient to power the entire home 

ELON MUSK:
It depends on your energy on how efficient-

JOE ROGAN:
Expenditure 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. So, generally yes. I would say it’s probably for most it’s going to vary, but anywhere from more than you need to maybe half. Call it half to 1.5 of the energy that you need. Depending on how much roof you have relative to living space-

JOE ROGAN:
And how ridiculous you are with the TV.

ELON MUSK:
TV’s no problem. Air conditioners-

JOE ROGAN:
Blenders.

ELON MUSK:
Air conditioning.

JOE ROGAN:
Air conditioning 

ELON MUSK:
Air conditioning is the problem. If you have an efficient air conditioner and depending on how   Are you air conditioning rooms when they don’t need to be air conditioned, which is very common because it’s a pain in the neck. It’s like programming your VCR. It’s just blinking 12, so people just like, “The hell with that. I’m just going to make it this temperature all day long.”

JOE ROGAN:
Right. They don’t have a smart home where if you’re in the room then it stays cool. Right.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It should predict when you’re going to be home and then cool the rooms that you’re likely to use with a little but of intelligence. We’re not talking about genius home here. We’re just talking elementary basic stuff. If you could hook that into the car as you’re coming home  There’s no point in cooling the home, keeping the home really cool when you’re not there, but it can tell that you’re coming home it’s going to cool it to the right temperature right when you get there.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you have an app that works with your solar panels or anything like that 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Yeah, we do. But we need to hook it in to the air conditioning to really make the air conditioning work.

JOE ROGAN:
Have you thought about creating an air conditioning system  I know you have. Trick question.

ELON MUSK:
I cannot answer that questions about future or potential products.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay. Let’s just let it go. we’ll move on to the next thing.

ELON MUSK:
But that would be an interesting idea.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I would say. Radiant heating, all that. Good ideas. When you think about the efficiency of these homes and you think about implementing solar power, and battery power, and is there anything else that people are missing  Is there any other   I just saw a smart watch that is powered by the heat of the human body. Some new technology.

ELON MUSK:
It’s able to fully power that way 

JOE ROGAN:
I don’t know if it’s fully or if its   This watch right here, this is a Casio. It’s called a Protek, and it’s an outdoors watch, and it’s solar powered. So, it has the ability to operate for a certain amount of time on solar. So, if you have it exposed it could function for a certain amount of time on solar.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, well, there’s the self weighted watches watches where it’s got a weight in the watch and as you move your wrist the weight moves from one side to the other and it winds the watch up. That’s a pretty cool thing.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, yeah. Well, it’s amazing that Rolex’s, that it’s all done mechanically. There’s no batteries in there. There’s no nothing.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, you could do the same thing, create a little charger that’s based on wrist movement. It really depends on how much energy your watch uses.

JOE ROGAN:
You know what’s fucked up about that, though  We accept a certain amount of fuckery with those watches. I brought my watch   I have a Rolex that my friend Lorenzo gave and I brought it to the watch store and I said, “This thing’s always fast.” I said, “It’s always after a couple months its five minutes fast.” And they go, “Yep.” They go, “Yeah.”

ELON MUSK:
Really 

JOE ROGAN:
It’s just what it does.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
and I go, “Hold on, so you’re telling me that it just is always going to be fast ” They’re like, “Yeah. It’s just like every few months you’ve got to reset it.”

ELON MUSK:
Seems like the should recalibrate that thing.

JOE ROGAN:
They can’t. They tried. They say every few months, whether it’s four months, or five months, or six months, it’s going to be a couple minutes fast.

ELON MUSK:
Okay, it seems like they should really recalibrate that because it’s always fast  -

JOE ROGAN:
You should figure that shit out. Right.

ELON MUSK:
  you could just delete those minutes.

JOE ROGAN:
You need to fucking kick down the door at Rolex and go, “You bitches are lazy.”

ELON MUSK:
It’s amazing that you can keep time mechanically on a wrist watch with these tiny little gears.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s amazing. The whole luxury watch market is fascinating. I’m not that involved in terms like I don’t buy them. I bought them as gifts, but I don’t buy them for myself, but when I look at them online there’s million dollar watches out there now that they have little rotating moons and stars. They live   Look at this thing. How much is that one, Jamie 

JOE ROGAN:
Right around-

JOE ROGAN:
These are fucking preposterous.

ELON MUSK:
I like gears.

JOE ROGAN:
I love them.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I think they’re beautiful.

JOE ROGAN:
But there’s some of these people are just taking right in the ass. They’re buying these watches for $750,000.00. I’m like, “Yo, that’s a Timex, son. Nobody knows.” It’s not any better than some Casio that you could just buy online   Look at that, though. Here’s the thing, if you’re a person that doesn’t just want to know the time, you want craftsmanship, you want some artisan’s touch, you want innovation in terms of a person figuring out how gears and cogs all line up perfectly to every time it turns over its basically a second. That’s just   There’s art to that. It’s-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I agree.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it’s not just telling time. I like this watch a lot, but if it got hit by a rock I wouldn’t be sad. It’s just a watch. It’s  

 

JOE ROGAN:
  but if it got hit by a rock, I wouldn’t be sad.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s just a watch. It’s a mass produced thing that runs on some quartz battery. But those things, there’s art to that.

ELON MUSK:
No, I agree. It’s beautiful.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, love it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
There’s something amazing about it because it represents the human creativity. It’s not just an electronic innovation. There’s a person’s work in that.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
You don’t have a watch on 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Ever 

ELON MUSK:
I used to have a watch.

JOE ROGAN:
What happened 

ELON MUSK:
My phone tells the time.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s a good point. What if you lose your phone 

JOE ROGAN:
Wait, hold on.

ELON MUSK:
True.

JOE ROGAN:
Let me guess, you are a no case guy 

ELON MUSK:
That’s correct.

JOE ROGAN:
Ooh.

ELON MUSK:
Living on the edge. Living on the edge without a case.

JOE ROGAN:
Neil deGrasse Tyson, Neil deGrasse Tyson was in here last week. I marveled at his ability to get through life without a case.

ELON MUSK:
That’s right.

JOE ROGAN:
He takes his phone and he flips it in between his fingers, like a soldier would do with his rifle.

ELON MUSK:
Really 

JOE ROGAN:
He just rolls that shit in between his fingers.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
Marvelous.

ELON MUSK:
Wow.

JOE ROGAN:
He says that’s the reason why they do it. He said, “When you look at someone who has a rifle, why would they do that  Why would they flip it around like that ”

ELON MUSK:
Right.

JOE ROGAN:
So that when it goes to drop, they have it in their hand. They catch it quickly. That’s what he does with his phone. He’s just flipping his phone around all the time. I got that in Mexico. I was hoping it holds joints.

ELON MUSK:
Does it do anything  It seems to open.

JOE ROGAN:
No. It’s just a hole.

ELON MUSK:
Could store things in there.

JOE ROGAN:
Try to put a joint in there, close it. You can put like one, one blunt. One, that seems pretentious, you know  That’s the idea behind it. I bought it when I was in Mexico because I figured it would be a good size to hold joints. Guess not.

ELON MUSK:
So is that a joint, or is it a cigar 

JOE ROGAN:
No, it’s marijuana inside of a tobacco.

ELON MUSK:
Oh, okay. So it’s like part tobacco, part-

JOE ROGAN:
You never had that 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I think I tried one once.

 

JOE ROGAN:
You probably can’t because of stockholders, right 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, it’s legal, right 

JOE ROGAN:
Totally legal.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
How does that work  Do people get upset at you if you do certain things 

JOE ROGAN:
There’s tobacco and marijuana in there. That’s all it is. The combination of tobacco and marijuana is wonderful. First turned onto it by Charlie Murphy, and then reignited by Dave Chappelle. There you go.

 

ELON MUSK:
Ha ha, exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
Perfect, balances it out.

ELON MUSK:
Alcohol is a drug, it’s been grandfathered in.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, it’s not just a drug. It’s a drug that gets a bad rap because if you just have a little, it’s great.

ELON MUSK:
Fine.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, a little sip here and there, and your inhibitions are relaxed, and it shows your true self, and hopefully you’re more joyous and friendly and happy, and everything’s good.

JOE ROGAN:
The real worry is the people that can’t handle it, like the real worry about people that can’t handle cars that can go zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds, or anything.

JOE ROGAN:
Have you ever considered something that, imagine if one day, everyone has a car that’s on the same at least technological standard as one of your cars  Everyone agrees that the smart thing to do is not just to have bumpers, but to perhaps have some sort of a magnetic repellent device; something, some electro magnetic field around the cars. And as cars come close to each other, they automatically radically decelerate because of magnets or something.

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean, our cars brake automatically.

JOE ROGAN:
Brake, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
When they see things.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
But like a physical barrier.

ELON MUSK:
Well, the wheels work pretty well as brakes.

JOE ROGAN:
The wheels do 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, they work pretty well. Decelerate at 1.1 to 1.2 G’s, that kind of thing.

JOE ROGAN:
Is your concern that one day all your cars would be on the road, and then there will still be regular people with regular cars, 20-30 years from now, that’ll get in the mix, and be the main problem 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I think it’d be sort of like   there was a time of transition where there were horses and gasoline cars on the road at the same time. Must’ve been pretty weird.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, that would be the weirdest.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
And horses were tricky, you know, back when Manhattan had like 300,000 horses, you figure like horse lives 15 years, you got 20,000 horses dropping dead every day, or every year I should say. Every year there’s 20,000 horses, if there’s 300,000 horses and a 15 year lifespan.

JOE ROGAN:
Back in the Gangs of New York days. That movie 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
It’s a lot of dead horses. You need a horse to move the horse.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
They’ll probably get pretty freaked out if they have to move a dead horse.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think they know what’s going on 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I mean it’s gotta be like, pretty weird.

JOE ROGAN:
No, I would imagine.

ELON MUSK:
Why am I dragging this dead horse around, and I’m a horse  I don’t like it.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you ever stop and think about your role in civilization  Do you ever stop and think about your role in the culture  Because me, as a person who never met you until today, when I think of you, I’ve always thought of you as being this weirdo super inventor dude, who just somehow or another keeps coming up with new shit. But there’s not a lot of you out there. Everybody else seems to be, I mean obviously, you make a lot of money, and there’s a lot of people that make a lot of money.

JOE ROGAN:
You like that clock 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Pretty dope, right 

ELON MUSK:
This is a great clock.

JOE ROGAN:
You want one  I’ll get you one.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay, done.

ELON MUSK:
I like weird things like this.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, this is the coolest. It’s TGT promotion. What it says, TGT Studios  TGT Studios 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s a gentleman who makes all this by hand. Yeah, it’s really cool.

ELON MUSK:
My study is filled with weird devices.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, get ready for another one.

ELON MUSK:
All right.

JOE ROGAN:
I’m sending it your way.

ELON MUSK:
Cool.

JOE ROGAN:
You wanna werewolf too  I’ll hook you up.

ELON MUSK:
All right. I’ll take one.

JOE ROGAN:
One werewolf, and one clock coming up.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think about your role in the culture  Because me as a person who never met you until today, I’ve always looked at you and like, “Wow, how’s this guy just keep inventing shit ”

JOE ROGAN:
How do you keep coming up with all these new devices  Do you ever consider how  

JOE ROGAN:
I had a dream once that there was a million Teslas. Instead of like one Tesla, there was a million Teslas.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
Not Tesla the car, but Nikola.

ELON MUSK:
Oh, yeah, sure.

JOE ROGAN:
And that in his day, there was a million people like him who were radically innovative.

ELON MUSK:
Wow.

JOE ROGAN:
It was a weird dream, man. It was so strange, and I’ve had it more than once.

ELON MUSK:
That would result in very rapid technology innovation, that’s for sure.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s one of the only dreams in my life I’ve had more than one time.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
Like where I’ve woken up and it’s in the same dream. I’m in the same dream. In this dream, it’s 1940s, 1950s, but everyone is severely advanced. There’s flying blimps with LCD screens on the side of them, and everything’s bizarre and strange.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s stuck with me, obviously it’s just a stupid dream, but for whatever reason, all these years, that stuck with me. It takes one man like Nikola Tesla to have more than 100 inventions that were patents, right  He had some-

ELON MUSK:
It’s pretty great.

JOE ROGAN:
  pretty fucking amazing ideas.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, definitely.

JOE ROGAN:
In his day, there was very few people like him.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, that’s true.

JOE ROGAN:
What if there was a million 

ELON MUSK:
Things would advance very quickly.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, but there’s not a million Elon Musks. There’s one motherfucker. Do you think about that, or you just try to not 

ELON MUSK:
Hmm.

ELON MUSK:
I don’t think you’d necessarily want to be me.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, what’s the worst part about you 

ELON MUSK:
I don’t think people would like it that much.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, most people wouldn’t, but they can’t be you. That’s like some superhero type shit. You wouldn’t wanna be Spider-Man, rather just sleep tight in Gotham City, and hope he’s out there doing his job.

ELON MUSK:
It’s very hard to turn it off.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
What’s the hardest part 

ELON MUSK:
It might sound great if it’s turned on.

JOE ROGAN:
Sleep 

ELON MUSK:
But what if it doesn’t turn off 

JOE ROGAN:
Now, I showed you the isolation tank, and you’ve never experienced that before 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
I think that could help you turn it off a little bit, just for the night.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, just give you a little bit of sleep, little bit of perspective, some magnesium that you get from the water as well, that makes you sleep easier because the water has Epsom salts in it. But maybe some sort of strategy for sacrificing your, not sacrificing, but enhancing your biological recovery time by figuring out a way, whether it’s through meditation or some other ways, to shut off that thing at night.

JOE ROGAN:
You must have like a constant stream of ideas that’s running through your head all the time. You getting text messages from chicks 

ELON MUSK:
No. I’m getting text messages from friends saying, “What the hell are you doing smoking weed ”

JOE ROGAN:
Is that bad for you  It’s legal. It’s government approved.

ELON MUSK:
It’s not   I’m not a regular smoker of weed.

JOE ROGAN:
How often do you smoke it 

ELON MUSK:
Almost never.

ELON MUSK:
I don’t actually notice any effect.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, there you go. There was a time where, I think it was Ram Dass or someone, gave some Buddhist monk a bunch of acid.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
And he ate it, and it had no effect on him.

ELON MUSK:
I doubt that.

JOE ROGAN:
I would say that too, but I’ve never meditated to the level that some of these people have, where they’re constantly meditating all day. They don’t have any material possessions, and all of their energy is spent trying to achieve a certain mindset. I would like to cynically deny that. I’d like to cynically say, “They just fucking think the same way I do. They just hang out with flip flops on and make weird noises.”

JOE ROGAN:
But maybe, no 

ELON MUSK:
I know a lot of people like weed, and that’s fine. But I don’t that it is very good for productivity.

JOE ROGAN:
For you 

ELON MUSK:
Not for me.

JOE ROGAN:
I would imagine that for someone like you, it’s not. Someone like you, it’d be more like a cup of coffee, right  You have a latte 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it’s more like the opposite of a cup of coffee.

JOE ROGAN:
What do you like 

ELON MUSK:
It’s like a cup of coffee in reverse.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, weed is 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
No, I’m saying you would like more, more like what would be beneficial to you, would be like coffee 

ELON MUSK:
I like to get things done. I like to be useful. That is one of the hardest things to do, is to be useful.

JOE ROGAN:
When you say you like to get things done, in terms of like what-

ELON MUSK:
I like to get things done.

JOE ROGAN:
  gives you satisfaction  When you complete a project, when something that you invent comes to fruition, and you see people enjoying it  That feeling 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Doing something useful for other people, that I like doing.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s interesting, “for other people.”

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think that that is maybe the way you recognize that you have this unusual position in the culture, where you can uniquely influence certain things because of this   I mean, essentially, you have a gift, right 

ELON MUSK:
Ha ha.

JOE ROGAN:
You would think it was a curse  I’m sure it’s been fueled by many, many years of discipline and learning, but you essentially have a gift. You have this radical sort of creativity engine when it comes to innovation and technology. It’s like, you’re just, you’re going at a very high RPMs.

ELON MUSK:
All the time.

JOE ROGAN:
What is that like 

ELON MUSK:
It doesn’t stop.

ELON MUSK:
I don’t know what would happen if I got into a sensory deprivation tank.

JOE ROGAN:
Let’s try it.

ELON MUSK:
It sounds concerning.

JOE ROGAN:
But why 

ELON MUSK:
It’s like running the engine with no resistance. That seems-

JOE ROGAN:
Is that what it is though  Maybe it’s not.

ELON MUSK:
Maybe it’s fine. I don’t know. I’ll try it. I’ll try it.

JOE ROGAN:
Have you ever experimented with meditation or anything 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
What’d you do, or what have you done rather 

ELON MUSK:
I mean just sort of sit there and be quiet, and then repeat some mantra, which acts as a focal point. It does still the mind. It does still the mind, but I don’t find myself drawn to it frequently.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you that perhaps productivity is maybe more attractive to you than enlightenment  Or even the concept of whatever enlightenment means. What are you trying to achieve when you’re meditating all the time 

JOE ROGAN:
With you it seems almost like there’s a franticness to your creativity, that comes out of this burning furnace. In order for you to calm that thing down, you might have to throw too much water on it.

ELON MUSK:
It’s like a never ending explosion.

JOE ROGAN:
What is it like  Try to explain it to a dumb person like me. What’s goin on in the head 

ELON MUSK:
A never ending explosion.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s just constant ideas, just bouncing around 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Damn.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
So when everybody leaves, it’s just Elon, sitting at home, brushing his teeth, just a bunch of ideas bouncing around in your head 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, all the time.

JOE ROGAN:
When did you realize that that’s not the case with most people 

ELON MUSK:
I think when I was, I don’t know, five or six or something. I thought I was insane.

JOE ROGAN:
Why’d you think you were insane 

ELON MUSK:
Because it was clear that other people did not   their mind wasn’t exploding with ideas all the time.

JOE ROGAN:
So they weren’t expressing it, they weren’t talking about it all day  And you realized, by the time you were five or six, like, Oh, they’re probably not even getting this thing that I’m getting ”

ELON MUSK:
No. It was just strange. It was like, “Hmm, I’m strange.” That was my conclusion. I’m strange.

JOE ROGAN:
Did you feel diminished by it in any way  Like knowing that this is weird thing, that you really probably couldn’t commiserate with, with other people  They wouldn’t understand you 

ELON MUSK:
I hoped they wouldn’t find out because they might put me away or something.

JOE ROGAN:
You thought that 

ELON MUSK:
For a second, yes.

JOE ROGAN:
When you were little 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I know they put people away. What if they put me away 

JOE ROGAN:
When you were little you thought this 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Wow.

JOE ROGAN:
You thought, “This is so radically different than the people that around me. If they find out I got this stream coming in  ”

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa.

ELON MUSK:
I was only like five or six.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think this is like, there’s outliers, biologically  I mean there’s people that are seven foot nine, there’s people that have giant hands. There’s people that have eyes that are 20/15 vision. There’s always outliers. Do you feel like you caught this, like you’ve got some, you’re on some weird innovation, creativity, sort of wave, that’s very unusual  You tapped into   just think of the various things you’ve been able to accomplish in a very short amount of time, and you’re constantly doing this. That’s a weird   you’re a weird person, right 

ELON MUSK:
Right, I agree.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
What if there’s a million Elon Musks 

ELON MUSK:
Well, that would be very, very weird.

JOE ROGAN:
Woo! Woo.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it’d be pretty weird. I agree.

JOE ROGAN:
Real weird.

ELON MUSK:
Definitely.

ELON MUSK:
What if there were a million Joe Rogans 

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, there probably is. There’s probably two million.

JOE ROGAN:
I mean, I think that’s the case with a lot of folks.

ELON MUSK:
My goal is try to do useful things, try to maximize the probability the future’s good, make the future exciting, something you look forward to. With Tesla, I try to make things that people love.

ELON MUSK:
How many things can you buy that you really love  That really give you joy  It’s so rare, so rare. I wish there were more things. That’s what we try to do, just make things that somebody loves.

JOE ROGAN:
When you think about making things that someone loves, do you specifically think about, like what things would improve people’s experience  What would change the way people interface with life  That would make them more relaxed or more happy  You really think   when you’re thinking about things like that, is that one of your considerations  What could I do that would help people 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
That maybe they wouldn’t be able to figure out.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, like, what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better  I think that a future where we are a space bearing civilization, and out there among the stars, this is very exciting. This makes me look forward to the future. This makes me want that future.

ELON MUSK:
There need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning. You wake in morning, you look forward to the day, forward to the future. A future where we are a space bearing civilization and out there among the stars, I think that’s very exciting. That is a thing we want. Whereas if we knew we would not be a space bearing civilization, but forever confined to Earth, this would not be a good future that would be very sad, I think.

JOE ROGAN:
It would be sad-

ELON MUSK:
I don’t want the sad future.

JOE ROGAN:
  in terms of just the finite lifespan of the Earth itself, and the solar system itself  That even though it’s possibly   how long do they feel like this sun and this solar system’s gonna exist  How many hundreds and millions of years 

ELON MUSK:
Well, it’s probably, if you’re saying, “When does the sun boil the oceans ”

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
About 500 million years.

JOE ROGAN:
Is it sad that we never leave because in 500 million years that happens  Is that what you’re saying 

ELON MUSK:
No, I just think like if there are two futures, and one future is we’re out there among the stars, the things we read about and see in science fiction movies, the good ones, are true. We have these starships and we’re going to see what other planets are like, and we’re a multi-planet species, and the scope and scale of consciousness is expanded across many civilizations and many planets, and many star systems. This is a great future. This is a wonderful thing to me. That’s what we should strive for.

JOE ROGAN:
But, that’s biological travel. That’s cells traveling physically to another location.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think that’s definitely where we’re going 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I don’t think so either. I used to think so, and now I’m thinking more likely less than ever. Almost every day, less likely.

ELON MUSK:
We can definitely go to the moon and Mars.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Do you think that we’ll colonize-

ELON MUSK:
And we can go to the asteroid belt, and we can go to the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, we could even get to Pluto.

JOE ROGAN:
That’d be the craziest place ever, if we colonized Mars, and re-terraformed it and turned it into like a big Jamaica. Just oceans and-

ELON MUSK:
I think we should. I think that it’d be-

JOE ROGAN:
I mean imagine-

ELON MUSK:
  great. That’d be great. Amazing.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s possible, right 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
We can turn the whole thing into Cancun.

ELON MUSK:
Well-

JOE ROGAN:
Over time.

ELON MUSK:
  it wouldn’t be easy, but yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
You could warm it up.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, you could warm it up. You could add air. You could get some water there. I mean over time, hundreds of millions of years, or whatever it takes.

ELON MUSK:
We’d be a multi-planet species.

JOE ROGAN:
That would be amazing.

ELON MUSK:
We’d be a multi-planet species, that’s what we wanna be. Great.

JOE ROGAN:
If we could legitimately air condition Saturn-

ELON MUSK:
I’m pro-human.

JOE ROGAN:
Me too. Yeah, me too.

ELON MUSK:
I love humanity. I think it’s great.

JOE ROGAN:
We’re glad, as a robot, that you love humans because we love you too. We don’t want you to kill us, and eat us.

ELON MUSK:
You know, strangely, I think a lot of people don’t like humanity, and see it as a blight, but I do not.

JOE ROGAN:
I think one of those, I think part of that is just they’ve been struggling. When people struggle, they associate their struggle with other people. They never internalize their problems. They look to other people as holding them back, and people such, and fuck people. It’s just a never ending cycle, but not always. Again, most people, are really good. Most people, the vast majority.

ELON MUSK:
This may sound corny.

JOE ROGAN:
It does sound corny.

ELON MUSK:
But love is the answer.

JOE ROGAN:
It is the answer.

ELON MUSK:
Yep.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it is. It sounds corny because we’re all scared. We’re all scared of trying to love people, being rejected, or someone taking advantage of you because you’re trying to be loving.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
But if we all could just relax, and love each other  

ELON MUSK:
It wouldn’t hurt to have more love in the world.

JOE ROGAN:
It definitely wouldn’t hurt.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It’d be great.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, we should do that.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. I agree, man.

ELON MUSK:
Like really.

JOE ROGAN:
How you gonna fix that  You have a love machine that you’re working on 

ELON MUSK:
No, but probably spend more time with your friends, and less time on social media.

JOE ROGAN:
Now deleting social media from your applications, from your phones. Does that give you a ten percent boost to happiness  What do you think the percentage is 

ELON MUSK:
I think probably something like that, yeah. That’s about right.

JOE ROGAN:
Good ten percent.

ELON MUSK:
I mean the only thing I’ve kept is Twitter because I kind of like need some means of getting a message out, you know 

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
That’s about it, so far so good.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, what’s interesting with you, you actually occasionally engage with people on Twitter.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
What percentage of that is a good idea 

ELON MUSK:
Ha ha ha.

ELON MUSK:
Good question.

JOE ROGAN:
Probably ten percent, right  It’s hard.

ELON MUSK:
It’s mostly, I think it’s on balance more good than bad, but there’s definitely some bad. Hopefully the good outweighs the bad.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you ever think about how odd it is, the weird feeling that you get when someone says something shitty to you on Twitter, and you read it  The weird feeling. This weird little negative jolt. It’s like a subjective, negative jolt of energy that you don’t really need to absorb, but you do anyway. “Well, fuck this guy. Fuck him!”

ELON MUSK:
There’s a lot of negativity on Twitter.

JOE ROGAN:
It is, but it’s a weird, in its form, like the way if you ingest it as if you were like   you try to be like a little scientist, as you’re ingesting it. You’re like, “What  How weird is this that I’m even getting upset at some strange person saying something mean to me ” It’s not even accurate.

ELON MUSK:
I mean the vast number of negative comments, for the vast majority, I just ignore them, the vast majority.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Every now and again, you’re drawn in. It’s not good.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s not good.

ELON MUSK:
You make mistakes.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes, you can make mistakes.

ELON MUSK:
Make some mistakes.

JOE ROGAN:
We’re all human. We can make mistakes. Yeah, it’s hard, and people love it when you say something, and you take it back. They’re like, “Fuck you, we saved it forever. We fucking screenshot that shit, bitch. You had that thought! You had that thought!”

JOE ROGAN:
You’re like, “Well, I deleted it.”

JOE ROGAN:
“Not good enough! You had the thought! I’m better than you. I never had that thought. You had that thought, you piece of shit. Look, I saved it. I put it on my blog.”

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I’m not sure why people think that anyone would think that deleting a tweet makes it go away. It’s like, “Hello, there’s been an internet for a while.”

JOE ROGAN:
Well, it’s even like-

ELON MUSK:
Anything is forever.

JOE ROGAN:
  they don’t want you to be able to delete it because the problem is, if you don’t delete, and you don’t believe it anymore, it’s really hard to say, “Hey, that thing above, I don’t really believe that anymore. I changed the way I view things.”

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Because people go, “Well, fuck you. I already have that over there. I’m gonna just take that. I’m not gonna pay attention to that shit you wrote underneath.”

ELON MUSK:
It’s on your permanent record.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s forever, bro, like a tattoo.

ELON MUSK:
We’ll put this on your permanent record.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it’s like a tattoo, you keep it.

ELON MUSK:
Oh, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, it’s this thing where there’s a lack of compassion. It’s a lack of compassion issue. People are just like intentionally shitty to each other all the time online, and trying to catch   They’re more trying to catch people doing something that’s arrestable, like a cop trying to get arrests on his record. It’s like they’re trying to catch you with something, more than they’re logically looking at it, thinking it’s a bad thing that you’ve done, or that it’s an idea they don’t agree with so much they need to insult you. They’re trying to catch you.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it’s way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be in person.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
Way easier.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s weird. It’s not a normal way of human interacting. It’s cheating.

ELON MUSK:
True.

JOE ROGAN:
We’re not supposed to be able to interact so easily with people we’re not looking at.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
You would never do that. You’d never be so mean to someone looking in their eyes, and if you did you’d feel like shit.

ELON MUSK:
Most people.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, unless you’re a sociopath, you’d feel terrible.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Elon Musk, this has been a pleasure.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, likewise.

JOE ROGAN:
It really has been.

ELON MUSK:
It’s been an honor. Thank you for having me.

JOE ROGAN:
Thanks for doing this because I know you don’t do a lot of long form stuff like this. I hope I didn’t weird you out, and hope you don’t get mad that you smoked weed. It’s not bad. It’s legal! We’re in California. This is just as legal as this whiskey we’ve been drinking.

ELON MUSK:
Exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
This is all good, right 

ELON MUSK:
Cheers.

JOE ROGAN:
Cheers.

JOE ROGAN:
Thank you.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there any message you would like to put out other than love is the answer because I think you’ve really nailed it with that 

ELON MUSK:
No, I think people should be nicer to each other, and give more credit to others, and don’t assume that they’re mean until you know they’re actually mean. Just, it’s easy to demonize people, you’re usually wrong about it. People are nicer than you think. Give people more credit.

JOE ROGAN:
I couldn’t agree more. I wanna thank you, not just for all the crazy innovations you’ve come up with, and your constant flow of ideas, but that you choose to spread that idea, which is very vulnerable, but it’s very honest.

ELON MUSK:
It’s true.

JOE ROGAN:
It resonates with me, and I believe it.

ELON MUSK:
It’s true.

JOE ROGAN:
I believe it’s true too, so thank you.

ELON MUSK:
You’re welcome.

JOE ROGAN:
All you assholes out there, be nice. Be nice, bitch.

JOE ROGAN:
All right, thank you, everybody. Thank you, Elon.

ELON MUSK:
All right, thank you.

JOE ROGAN:
Goodnight, everybody.

 

JOE ROGAN:
Welcome back.

ELON MUSK:
Here we go again.

JOE ROGAN:
Great to see you and congratulations.

ELON MUSK:
Thank you.

JOE ROGAN:
You will never forget what is going on in the world when you think about when your child is born. You will know for the rest of this child’s life, you were born during a weird time.

ELON MUSK:
That’s for sure.

JOE ROGAN:
That is for sure. Probably the weirdest that I can remember.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Yeah, and he was born on May the fourth.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s hilarious, too.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
May the fourth be with him.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
It has to be.

ELON MUSK:
Hopefully. I sure hope so.

JOE ROGAN:
Perfect.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
I mean that was the perfect day for you. How do you say the name  Is it placeholder 

ELON MUSK:
First of all, my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name.

JOE ROGAN:
Congratulations to her.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. She’s great at names. I mean it’s just X, the letter X, and then the ae is like pronounced ash. Yeah, and then eight, 12 is my contribution.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, why are eight, 12 

ELON MUSK:
Archangel 12, the precursor to the SR71. Coolest plane ever. True.

JOE ROGAN:
I agree with you. I don’t know, I’m not familiar with it. I know what the SR71 is.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I know what that is.

ELON MUSK:
The SR71 came from a CIA program called Archangel. It’s the Archangel project.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh wow, what a dope looking plane.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, okay. I got it.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, as a person who’s a very much into aerial travel as you are, that’s perfect.

ELON MUSK:
It’s pretty great.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Pretty great. Does it feel strange to have a child while this craziness is going  Does it feel like you’ve had children before  Is this any weirder 

ELON MUSK:
Actually, I think it’s better being older and having a kid. I appreciate it more. Yeah, babies are awesome.

JOE ROGAN:
They are pretty awesome.

ELON MUSK:
They’re awesome. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
When I didn’t have any of my own, I would see other people’s kids and I didn’t not like them, but I wasn’t drawn to them. But now when I see little people’s kids, I’m like, Oh, I think of them as like these little love packages.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, little love bugs.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. It’s just you think of them differently when you see them come out and then grow and then eventually start talking to you, like your whole idea what a baby is, is very different.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, as you get older and get to appreciate it as a mature, fully formed adult, it must be really pretty wonderful.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Great. Wonderful. It’s great. But babies are awesome. Yeah, it’s great. Yeah. Also, I’ve spent a lot of time on AI and neural nets and so you can sort of see the brain develop, which is   An AI neural net is trying to simulate what a brain does, basically. You can sort of see it learning very quickly. You know, it’s just wow.

JOE ROGAN:
You’re talking about the neural net, you’re not talking about an actual baby.

ELON MUSK:
I’m talking about an actual baby.

JOE ROGAN:
But both of them.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, but the word neural net comes from the brain. It’s like a net of neurons. Humans are the original gangster of the neural net.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s a great way to put it.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
When you’re programming artificial intelligence where you’re working with artificial intelligence art, are they specifically trying to mimic the developmental process of a human brain 

ELON MUSK:
In a lot of ways. There’s some ways that are different. An analogy that’s often used is like we don’t make a submarine swim like a fish, but we take the principles of hydrodynamics and apply them to the submarine.

JOE ROGAN:
I’ve always wondered as a lay person, do you try to achieve the same results as the human brain but through different methods  Or do you try to copy the way a human brain achieves results 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, the essential elements of an AI neural net are really very similar to a human brain neural net. Yeah. It’s having the multiple layers of neurons and you know, back propagation. All these things are what your brain does. You have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition and then it’ll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place. It’s interesting. Very interesting.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I would imagine. The thought of programming something that is eventually going to be smarter than us that one day it’s going to be like, why did you do it that way  When artificial intelligence becomes sentient, they’re like, Oh, you tried to mimic yourself. This is so much better process. Cut out all this nonsense.

ELON MUSK:
Like I said, there are elements that are the same but just like an aircraft does not fly like a bird.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
It doesn’t flap its wings, but the wings, the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as a bird.

JOE ROGAN:
Now you’re in the middle of this strange time where you’re selling your houses. You say you don’t want any material possessions and I’ve been seeing all that and I’ve been really excited to talk to you about this. Because it’s an interesting thing to come from a guy like yourself. Like why are you doing that 

ELON MUSK:
I’m slightly sad about it, actually.

JOE ROGAN:
If you’re sad about it, why are you doing it 

ELON MUSK:
I think possessions kind of weigh you down and they’re kind of an attack vector. They’ll say, “Hey, billionaire, you’ve got all this stuff.” Well, now I don’t have stuff now what are you going to do 

JOE ROGAN:
Attack vector meaning like people targeted.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Interesting, yeah. But you’re obviously going to, so you’re going to rent a place 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay, and get rid of everything except clothes 

ELON MUSK:
No, I said like almost everything, so it’s like  

JOE ROGAN:
Keep a couple of Teslas.

ELON MUSK:
Kind of have to, to test product and stuff. You know, there’s things that have sentimental value for sure are keeping those.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you feel like    

ELON MUSK:
I mean, what’s the worst that could happen  I mean, you’re fine.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, you can always buy more stuff if you don’t like it.

ELON MUSK:
I suppose so.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I mean from the money that you sell all your stuff, you can buy new stuff. Do you feel like people define you by the fact that you’re wealthy and that they define you in a pejorative way 

ELON MUSK:
For sure. I mean not everyone, but for sure in recent years billionaire has become pejorative like that’s a bad thing. Which I think doesn’t make a lot of sense in most cases. If you basically organized a company   How does this wealth arise  If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital.

ELON MUSK:
There’s a conflation of consumption and capital allocation. Take Warren Buffet, for example, and to be totally frank I’m not his biggest fan, but you know, he does like have full allocation and he reads a lot of annual reports of companies and all the accounting and it’s pretty boring really. He’s trying to figure out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital  I mean it’s kind of a boring job if you ask me.

ELON MUSK:
It’s still a thing that’s important to figure out. Like, which is a company deserving of more or less capital. Should that company grow or expand  Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse  If a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital and if it’s not, it should get less or go out of business.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, there’s a big difference, too, between someone who’s making an incredible amount of money designing and engineering fantastic products versus someone who’s making an incredible amount of money by investing in companies or moving money around in the stock market or doing things along those lines. It’s a different thing and to put them all in the same category seems, it’s very simple. As you pointed out, it’s an attack vector.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, for sure. I think it’s really, I do think there, in the United States especially, there’s an over allocation of talent in finance and law. Basically, too many smart people go into finance and law. This is both a compliment and a criticism. We should have, I think, fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Well that would certainly be better for all involved if they made better stuff.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Manufacturing used to be highly valued in the United States and these days it’s not. It’s often looked down upon, which I think is wrong.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Well, I think that people are kind of learning that particularly because of this whole pandemic and this relationship that we have with China, that there’s a lot of value in making things and to making things here.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Somebody’s got to do the real work.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
You know  Making a car, it’s an honest days living, that’s for sure. Making anything, really, or providing a valuable service like providing good entertainment, good information, these are all valuable things to do. Yeah, there should be more of it.

JOE ROGAN:
Did you have a moment where, is this something that this idea of getting rid of your material possessions is it something that built up over time or did you have a moment of realization where you realized that  

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it for a while. You know, part of it is like I have a bunch of houses, but I don’t spend a lot of time in most of them. That doesn’t seem like a good use of assets. Somebody could probably be enjoying those houses and get better use of them me.

JOE ROGAN:
Don’t you have Gene Wilder’s house 

ELON MUSK:
I do.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s amazing.

ELON MUSK:
It’s awesome.

JOE ROGAN:
Wow.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. It’s exactly what you’d expect.

JOE ROGAN:
Did you request that the buyer not fuck it up 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, that’s a requirement.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, a requirement  That’s a good requirement.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
In that case in that house.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it’ll probably sell for less, but still I don’t care.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, he’s a legend. He’d want his soul, he’d want his essence in the building.

ELON MUSK:
And it’s there.

JOE ROGAN:
Is it 

ELON MUSK:
It’s a real quirky house, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
What makes you say that  What do you get out of it 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, all the cabinets are like handmade and they’re like odd shapes and there’s like doors to nowhere and strange corridors and tunnels and odd paintings on the wall. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Did you ever live in it 

ELON MUSK:
It’s very quirky. I did live in it briefly, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
But why do you buy houses  If you own all these houses, do you just get bored and go I think I’d like to have that 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I had one house and the Gene Wilder house is right across the road from me from my main house. It was going to get sold and then torn down and turned into, you know, be a big construction zone for three years. I was like, whoa, I think I’ll buy it and preserve the spirit of Gene Wilder and not have a giant construction zone. Then I started having some privacy issues where people would just come to my house and start climbing over the walls and stuff. I’m like, man  

ELON MUSK:
Then I sort of bought some of the houses around my house and then I thought at one point, well you know, it’d be cool to build a house. I acquired some properties at the top of Somera Road, which has got a great view, and I was like, okay, well there’s a bunch of sort of small older houses, they’re going to get torn down, anyway. I was like, well, if I collect these little houses then I can build something, I don’t know, artistic like a dream house type of thing.

JOE ROGAN:
What’s a dream house for Elon Musk  Like some Tony stark type shit 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, definitely. Yeah. You got to have the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing, you know 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
For sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Fuck yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Definitely. But then I was like, man, does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I’d be real, you know, ghetto like OCD on the little details and the design, or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars  I should probably do the latter. Like what’s more important  Mars or a house  I’m like Mars. Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
Is that really how you think  Like, I’d be better off planning on a trip to Mars or getting people to Mars 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, you can only do so many things.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Right, so how are you going to  

JOE ROGAN:
Well, I don’t know how you do what you do anyway. I don’t understand how you can run The Boring Company, Tesla, SpaceX, all these different things you’re doing constantly. I just, I don’t understand. I mean, you explained last time you were here how you sort of allocate your time and how hectic it is and insane. I still don’t, the productivity is baffling. It just doesn’t make sense how you can get so much done.

ELON MUSK:
Well, I think I do have high productivity, but even with that there’s still some opportunity to   time and allocating time to building a house, even if it was a really great house, it still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary to get us to Mars and helping solve sustainable energy. SpaceX and Tesla are by far, you know, the most amount of brain cycles. The Boring Company does not take, you know, it’s like less than 1% of brain cycles. Then this neural link, which is, I don’t know, maybe it’s like 5% and then  

JOE ROGAN:
5%  That’s a good chunk.

ELON MUSK:
It’s a good chunk. Yeah, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
We were talking about that last time and you were trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live, when it’s actually going to be available. Are you testing on people right now 

ELON MUSK:
No, we’re not testing on people yet, but I think it won’t be too long. I think we may be able to implant a neural link in less than a year in a person I think.

JOE ROGAN:
When you do this, is there any tests that you have to do before you do something like this to see what percentage of people’s bodies are going to reject these things  Is there a potential for rejection 

ELON MUSK:
It’s a very low potential for rejection. I mean, you can think of it like people put in heart monitors and things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation obviously like artificial hips and knees and that kind of thing. The probability of, I mean, so it’s well known what will cause rejection and what will not. It’s definitely harder when you’ve got something that is sort of reading and writing neurons that’s generating a current pulse and reading current pulses. That’s a little harder than say a passive device, but it’s still very doable. There are people who have primitive devices in their brains right now.

JOE ROGAN:
What kind of devices 

ELON MUSK:
Well, like deep brain stimulation, I think for Parkinson’s, has really changed people’s lives in a big way, which is kind of remarkable because it kind of like zaps your brain. It’s like kicking the TV type of thing. You think like man, kicking the TV shouldn’t work.

JOE ROGAN:
It does sometimes.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
The old TVs.

ELON MUSK:
It did.

JOE ROGAN:
My grandpa used to slap the top.

ELON MUSK:
For sure. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It would work sometimes.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, so this deep brain stimulation implanted devices in the brain have changed people’s lives for the better like fundamentally.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, let’s talk about what you can talk about to what Neuralink is cause the last time you were here you really couldn’t discuss it. Then there was, I guess a press release or something that sort of outlined    

ELON MUSK:
Oh yeah, sure, sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, that had happened quite a bit after the last time you were here. What exactly is it  How do you do, what happens if someone ultimately does get a Neuralink installed what will take place 

ELON MUSK:
Well, for version one of the device, it would be it basically implanted in your skull. It would be flush with your skull, so you basically take out a chunk of skull, put the Neuralink device in there. You’d insert the electrode threads very carefully into the brain and then you stitch it up and you wouldn’t even know that somebody has it. It can interface basically anywhere in your brain. It could be something that helps cure say eyesight, like returns your eyesight even if you’ve lost your optic nerve type of thing.

JOE ROGAN:
Really 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, pretty much anything that it could, in principle, fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain. It could restore limb functionality, so if you’ve got an interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that’s like a microcontroller and near muscle groups, you could then create sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who is a quadriplegic to full functionality. Like they can walk around and be normal.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, maybe slightly better.

JOE ROGAN:
Slightly better 

ELON MUSK:
Over time, yes.

JOE ROGAN:
You mean with future iterations 

ELON MUSK:
Like the, you know, $6 million man. Although these days that doesn’t sound like much.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, that’s pretty cheap.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
$6 billion man.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
The hole would be small, how big would the hole be that you have to drill and then replace with this piece  It’s only one hole 

ELON MUSK:
Well, yeah, the device we’re working on right now is about, it’s about an inch in diameter. Your skull is pretty thick, by the way.

JOE ROGAN:
Mine is for sure.

ELON MUSK:
It might actually, literally, I mean if you’re a big guy, your skull is actually fairly thick. A skull is like seven to 14 millimeters.

JOE ROGAN:
Mines probably a couple of inches.

ELON MUSK:
A half inch. Half inch thick skull ish. Yeah, yeah, that’s a fair bit of like   We’ve got quite a coconut going on there. It’s not like some eggshell.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh yeah, I believe you.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, you basically implant the device.

JOE ROGAN:
It would be like a one inch square  One inch in diameter, so an inch circle 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, think like a smartwatch or something like that.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, okay.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay, so you take this one diameter like ice fishing, right  You ever go ice fishing 

ELON MUSK:
No, but I’d like to.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s great. It’s really fun, so you basically take an auger and you drill through the surface of the ice and you create a small hole. You can dunk your line in there. This is like that. You’re ice fishing on the top of your skull and then you cork it.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, and you replace that say one inch diameter piece of skull with the Neuralink device and that has a battery and a Bluetooth and an inductive charger. Then you also insert the electrodes. The electrodes are very carefully inserted with a robot that we developed. It’s very carefully putting in the electrodes and avoiding any veins or arteries so it doesn’t create trauma.

JOE ROGAN:
Through this one inch diameter device, electrodes would be inserted and they will find their way  

ELON MUSK:
Like tiny wires, basically.

JOE ROGAN:
Tiny wires.

ELON MUSK:
Tiny wires.

JOE ROGAN:
They’ll find their way to specific areas of the brain to stimulate 

ELON MUSK:
No, you literally put them where they’re supposed to go.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, okay.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, you insert  

JOE ROGAN:
How long would these wires be 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, they usually go in like, depending on where it is, like two or three millimeters.

JOE ROGAN:
They just find the spots 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Wow.

ELON MUSK:
Then you put the device in and that replaces the little piece of skull that was taken out. Then you stitch up the hole and they just look like a little scar and that’s it.

JOE ROGAN:
Would this be replaceable or reversible 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Like if someone can’t take it anymore  I’m too smart, I can’t take it.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, you can totally take it out.

JOE ROGAN:
Besides restoring limb function and eyesight and hearing, which are all amazing, is there any cognitive benefits that you anticipate from something like this 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I mean you could for sure, I mean, basically it’s a generalized sort of thing for fixing any kind of brain injury in principle, or if you’ve got like severe epilepsy or something like that. It could just sort of stop the epilepsy from occurring. It could detect it in real time and then fire a counter pulse and stop the epilepsy. I mean, there’s a whole range of brain injuries. Like if somebody gets a stroke, they could lose the ability to speak and that could also be fixed. If you’ve got like stroke damage or you lose say muscle control over part of your face or something like that. When you get older you tend to, if you’ve got like Alzheimer’s or something like that, then you lose memory and this could help you with restoring your memory and that kind of thing.

JOE ROGAN:
Restoring memory and what is happening that’s allowing it to do that  Like the wires, these small wires are stimulating these areas of the brain. Is it that the areas of the brain are losing some sort of electrical force  What is happening 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah 

ELON MUSK:
The thing is it’s like a bunch of circuits and there’s some circuits that are broken and we can fix those circuits. It’s a substitute for those circuits.

JOE ROGAN:
A specific frequency will go through this 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Is the process figuring out how much or how little has to be, how much these areas of the brain have to be juiced up 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, there’s still a lot of work to do. When I say we’ve got a shot at probably putting in a person within a year, that’s exactly what I mean. I think we have a chance of putting it into one and having them be healthy and restoring some functionality that they’ve lost.

JOE ROGAN:
The fear is that eventually you’re going to have to cut the whole top of someone’s head off and put a new top with a whole bunch of wires if you want to get the real turbo charged version. The P 100 D of brain stimulation.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, ultimately if you want to go with full AI symbiosis, you’ll probably want to do something like that.

JOE ROGAN:
Symbiosis is a scary word when it comes to AI.

ELON MUSK:
It’s optional.

JOE ROGAN:
I would hope so.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s just, I mean, once you enjoy the Doctor Manhattan lifestyle, once you become a god seems very unlikely you’re going to want to go back to being stupid again. I mean, you literally could fundamentally change the way human beings interface with each other.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
You wouldn’t need to talk.

JOE ROGAN:
I’m so scared of that, but so excited about it at the same time. Is that weird 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I think this is one of the paths to think like what are   Like AI is getting better and better. Now let’s assume it’s sort of like a benign AI scenario. Even in a benign scenario, we’re kind of left behind. We’re not along for the ride. We’re just too dumb.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
How do you go along for the ride  It’s like you can’t beat them, join them. We’re already a cyborg to some degree, right  Cause you’ve got your phone, you’ve got your laptop.

JOE ROGAN:
Glasses.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. Your electronic devices.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Today, if you don’t bring your phone along it’s like you have missing limb syndrome. It feels like something’s really missing. We’re already partly a cyborg or an AI symbiote, essentially it’s just that the data rate to the electronics is slow. Especially output, like you’re just going with your thumbs. I mean like what’s your data rate  Optimistically, a hundred bits per second. That’s being generous.

ELON MUSK:
Now the computer can communicate at like a hundred terabytes. Certainly, you know, gigabits are trivial at this point. This is like, yeah, basically your computer could do things a million times faster. At a certain point it’s like talking to a tree. Okay  It’s just boring. You talk to a tree it’s not very entertaining. If you can solve the data rate issue and you’re especially output input, too, then you can improve the symbiosis that is already occurring between man and machine.

JOE ROGAN:
You can improve it in what, when you said you won’t have to talk to each other anymore. We used to joke around about that. I’ve joked around about that a million times in this podcast that one day in the future there’s going to come a time where you can read each other’s minds. You’ll be able to interface with each other in some sort of a nonverbal, non-physical way where you will transfer data back and forth to each other without having to actually use your mouth. You’ll make noises.

ELON MUSK:
Exactly, so when you   Like what happens when you, let’s say you’ve got some complex idea that you’re trying to convey to somebody else and how do you do that  Well, your brain spends a lot of effort compressing a complex concept into words and there’s a lot of loss, information loss that occurs when compressing a complex concept into words. Then you say those words and those words are then interpreted, then they’re decompressed by the person who is listening. They will, at best, get a very incomplete understanding of what you’re trying to convey. It’s very difficult to convey a complex concept with precision because you’ve got compression, decompression, you may not even have heard all the words correctly and so communication is difficult. What we have here is a failure to communicate. Cool add Luke.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes. Great movie.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, great on.

JOE ROGAN:
There’s an interpretation factor, too. Like you can choose to interpret certain series of words in different ways and they’re dependent upon tone, dependent upon social cues, even facial expressions, sarcasm. There’s a lot of variables.

ELON MUSK:
Sarcasm is difficult.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
One of the things that I’ve said is like that there could be potentially a universal language that’s created through computers that particularly young kids would pick up very quickly. Like, my kids do Tik Tok and all this jazz and I don’t know what they’re doing. They just know how to do it and they know how to do it really quickly. Like they learn really quickly and they show me how to edit things and it’s, if you taught a child from first grade on how to use some new universal language  

JOE ROGAN:
 from first grade on, how to use some new universal language. I mean essentially like a Rosetta Stone and something that’s done, that interprets your thoughts and you can convey your thoughts with no room for interpretation. With clear, very clear, where you know what a person’s saying and you could tell them what you’re saying. There’s no need for noises, no need for mouth noises.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
No need for these accepted ways that we’ve evolved to make sounds that we all agree, through our cultural dictionary, and we agree. We could bypass all that.

ELON MUSK:
You can still do it for sentimental reasons.

JOE ROGAN:
Like campfires.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, exactly. You don’t need campfire. Don’t need to roast marshmallows to have fun.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
So, yeah, I think you would, in principle you would be able to communicate very quickly and with far more precision ideas and language would, I’m not sure what would happen to language. You could probably in a situation like this, you would be able to just, it’d be kind of like the matrix. You want to speak a different language. No problem.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Just download the program.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. So at least for the first iterations, first few iterations. I know that Google has some of their pixel buds have the ability to interpret languages in real time.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. You can hear it and it’ll play things back to you in whatever language you choose. So it’d be something along those lines.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
For the first few iterations.

ELON MUSK:
Well the first few iterations are, what I’m talking about is in the limit over time, with a lot of development. The first few iterations really in the first few versions all we’re going to be trying to do is solve brain injuries. So, don’t worry. It’s not going to sneak up on you. This will take awhile.

JOE ROGAN:
How many years  Before you don’t have to talk.

ELON MUSK:
If the development continues to accelerate then maybe five years. Five to 10 years.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s quick. That’s really quick.

ELON MUSK:
That’s the best case scenario.

JOE ROGAN:
No talking anymore in five years.

ELON MUSK:
Best case scenario, but 10 years is more like it.

JOE ROGAN:
I’ve always speculated that aliens could potentially be us in the future because if you look at the size of their heads and the fact that they have very little muscle, they don’t use their mouth anymore. They have this tiny little, I mean the archetype of an alien that you see in like Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

JOE ROGAN:
They’re like if you went from australopithecus or ancient hominid to us, what’s the difference  Less hair, less muscle, bigger head and then just keep going. A thousand, a million, whatever year or five years, whatever. Whatever happens when Neuralink goes on online and then we slowly start to adapt to this new way of being where we don’t use our muscles anymore. We have this gigantic head, we can talk without words.

ELON MUSK:
You could also save state.

JOE ROGAN:
Save state 

ELON MUSK:
Save your brain state like a saved game in a video game.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa. Like if you want to swap from Windows 95.

ELON MUSK:
Well, hopefully a little better than that. But, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
I think we are Windows 95 right now.

ELON MUSK:
From a   perspective probably. But yeah, I mean you could save state and restore that state into a biological being if you wanted to in the future in principle, nothing from a physics standpoint that prevents us. Now, you’d be a little different, but then you’re also a little different when you wake up in the morning from yesterday and you’re a little different. In fact, if you say like you five years ago versus you today is quite a big difference.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
So you’d be substantially you. I mean you’d certainly think you’re you.

JOE ROGAN:
But the idea of saving yourself and then transforming that into some sort of a biological state, you can hang out with 30 year old you 

ELON MUSK:
I mean the possibilities are endless.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s so weird.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, just think like how your phone, you can record videos from your phone. There’s no way you could remember a video as accurately as your phone or a camera could. So now if you’ve got like some version 10 Neuralink, whatever and far in the future, you could recall everything, just like it’s a movie.

JOE ROGAN:
Crystal clear.

ELON MUSK:
Including all the entire sensory experience.

JOE ROGAN:
Emotions, everything.

ELON MUSK:
Everything.

JOE ROGAN:
Everything.

ELON MUSK:
Everything and play it back and in fact you can edit it.

JOE ROGAN:
Edit it 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
So you can change your past 

ELON MUSK:
You could change what you think was your past. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, so if you had a dramatic experience 

ELON MUSK:
This whole thing right now could be a replayed memory.

JOE ROGAN:
It could be.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It may be. What’s the odds of this being a replayed memory  If you had a guess. More than 50%.

ELON MUSK:
There’s no way to assign a probability with accuracy here.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. But roughly, if you had a just gut instinct.

ELON MUSK:
Well, I don’t have a Neuralink in my brain, so I’d say right now 0%, but at the point at which you do have a Neuralink, then it rises above 0%.

JOE ROGAN:
The idea that we’re experiencing some sort of a preserved memory is, even though it’s still the same, it’s not comforting. Right  For some reason when people talk about simulation theory, they talk about the potential for this currently being a simulation. Even though your life might be wonderful, you might be in love, you might love your career, you might have great friends, but it’s not comforting to know that this experience somehow or another doesn’t exist in a material form that you can knock on.

ELON MUSK:
It feels real doesn’t it 

JOE ROGAN:
It feels real. But the idea that it’s not, for some strange reason, disconcerting.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I’m sure, it should be disconcerting because if this is not real, what is  But, there’s that old sort of thought experiment of like, how do you know you’re not a brain in a vent  I mean now here’s the thing. You are a brain in a vent, then that vat is your skull.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
Everything you see, feel, hear, everything, all your senses are electrical signals, everything. Everything is an electrical signal to a brain in a vent with a vat as our skull.

JOE ROGAN:
All your hormones, all your neuro-transmitters, all these things are drugs. Adrenaline’s a drug. Dopamine is a drug. You’re a drug factory. You’re constantly changing your state with love and oxytocin and beauty.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Changes your state. Great music changes your state.

ELON MUSK:
Absolutely. Yet, here’s another sort of interesting idea, which is, because you say like where did consciousness arise  Well, assuming you believe the belief in physics, which proves to be true, then the universe started off as basically quarks and leptons and it quickly became hydrogen and helium, lithium, basically elements of the periodic table. But it was mostly hydrogen basically. Then over a long period of time, 13.8 billion years later that hydrogen became sentient. What’s the line of consciousness and not consciousness between hydrogen and here 

JOE ROGAN:
When do we call it, when do we call it consciousness  I was watching a video today that we played on a podcast earlier of a monkey riding a motorcycle down the street, jumps off the motorcycle and tries to steal a baby.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I saw that one. It went viral.

JOE ROGAN:
Is that monkey conscious  It seems like it is. It seems like it had a plan. It was riding a fucking motorcycle and then jumped off the motorcycle to try to steal a baby.

ELON MUSK:
The one that just dragged the baby down the street pretty far 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. It seems pretty conscious, right 

ELON MUSK:
There’s definitely some degree of consciousness there.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. It’s not like a worm. It seems to be on another level. Yeah, and it’s going to keep going. That’s the real concern when people think about the potential future versions of human beings, especially when you consider symbiotic relationship to artificial intelligence, that will be unrecognizable.

JOE ROGAN:
That one day will be so far removed from what this is. We’ll look back on this, the way we look back now on simple organisms that we evolved from. That it won’t be that far in the future that we do have this view back.

ELON MUSK:
Well, I hope consciousness propagates into the future and it gets more sophisticated and complex and that it understands the questions to ask about the universe.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think that’s the case  As a human being, as yourself, you’re clearly trying to make conscious decisions to be a better version of you. This is the idea of like getting rid of your possessions and realizing that you’re trying to like, “I don’t like this. I will try to improve this. I would try to do a better version of the way I interface with reality.” That this is always the way things are, if you’re moving in some sort of a direction where you’re trying to improve things, you’re always going to move into this new place where you look back on the old place and go, “I was doing it wrong back then.” So this is an accelerated version of that. A super accelerated version of that.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, you don’t always improve, but you can aspire to improve or you can aspire to be less wrong.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
This is like, I think the tools of physics are very powerful. Just assume you’re wrong and your goal is to be less wrong. I don’t think you’re going to succeed every day in being less wrong, but if you’re going to succeed in being less wrong, most of the time you’re doing great.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s a great way of putting it. Aspire to be less wrong. But then when people look back in nostalgia about simpler times, there’s that too. It’s very romantic and exciting to look back on campfires.

ELON MUSK:
You can still have a campfire.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes. But will you appreciate it when you’re a super nerd  When you connect it to the grid and you have some skull cap in place of the top of your head and it’s interfacing with the international language that the rest of the universe now enjoys communication with people 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Sure. I think so. Yeah. I like campfires.

JOE ROGAN:
I’m just worried. I mean, everyone’s always scared of change, but I’m scared of this monumental change where we won’t talk anymore. I mean that thing that you  .

ELON MUSK:
We’ll communicate.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes, but there’s something about the beauty of the crudeness of language where when it’s done eloquently, it’s satisfying and it hits us in some sort of a visceral way. Like, ah, that person nailed it. I love that they nailed it. That it’s so hard to capture a real thought and convey it in a way, in this articulate way. You read a quote, a great quote by a wise person. It makes you excited that their mind figured something out, put the words together in a right way that makes your brain pop like, “Oh yes. Yes.”

ELON MUSK:
It’s clever compression of a concept and a feeling.

JOE ROGAN:
But the fact that a human did it too.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, absolutely.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think that it will be like electronic music  Like people won’t appreciate it like they appreciate a slide guitar 

ELON MUSK:
I like electronic music.

JOE ROGAN:
I do too. Well you make it. I know you like it.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I mean I hope the future is more fun and interesting and we’re just trying to make it that way.

JOE ROGAN:
I hope it’s more fun and interesting too.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
I just hope we don’t lose anything along the way.

ELON MUSK:
We might lose a little, but hopefully we gain more than lose.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. That’s the thing, right  Gaining more than we lose. Something that makes us interesting is that we’re so flawed.

ELON MUSK:
It’s not for sure. Yeah. I mean you look at civilization through the ages, most of them they rose and fell.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
I do think the globalization that we have, sort of like the meme sphere, is there’s not enough isolation between countries or regions. It’s like if you get, if there’s a mind virus that that mind virus can infect too much of the world. I actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people, because it’s like, man, we don’t ever want everywhere to be the same for sure. Then we need some kind of mind viral immunity. So that’s a bit concerning.

JOE ROGAN:
Mind viral immunity, meaning that once something like Neuralink gets established, the real concern is something that, I mean you said it’s Bluetooth, right  Or some future version of that. The idea is that something could possibly get into it, fuck it up.

ELON MUSK:
No, I’m talking about like somebody, some cockeyed concept that happens right now.

JOE ROGAN:
Well I know this virus is in embedded chips, right  They’ve embedded chips and then acquired viruses.

ELON MUSK:
Well, when I’m talking about a mind virus, I’m talking about a concept that infects people’s minds.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, okay. Okay. Like cult thinking or some sort of fundamentalism.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It’s just wrongheaded idea that goes viral in an idea sense.

JOE ROGAN:
Well that is a problem too, right  If someone can manipulate that technology to make something appear logical or rational.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Would that be an issue too, this is a very have versus have not issue. If this really does, I mean initially it’s going to help people with injuries, but you said ultimately it could lead to this spectacular cognitive change.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
But the people that first get it should have a massive advantage over people that don’t have it yet.

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean it’s the kind of thing where your productivity would improve, I don’t know, dramatically, maybe by a factor of 10 with it. So you could definitely just, I don’t know, take out a loan and do it and earn the money back real fast. Be super smart.

JOE ROGAN:
Well in a capitalist society, it seems like you could really get so far ahead that before everybody else could afford this thing and link up and get connected as well. You’d be so far ahead, they can never catch you. Is that a concern 

ELON MUSK:
Well, it’s not a super huge concern. I mean there are huge differences in cognitive ability and resources already. You can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective that’s far smarter than an individual. I couldn’t personally build a whole rocket and the engines and launch it and everything. That’s impossible.

ELON MUSK:
But we have 8,000 people at SpaceX and you’re piecing it out to different people and using computers and machines and stuff. We can make lots of rockets launch into orbit, dock with the space station and that kind of thing. So that already exists where those corporations are vastly more capable than an individual. But we should be, I think less concerned about relative capabilities between people and more like having AI be vastly beyond us and decoupled from human will.

JOE ROGAN:
Decoupled from human. So this is the, if you can’t beat them, join them 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
So you feel like it’s inevitable, AI, essentially AI is essentially inevitable.

ELON MUSK:
Super sentient to AI. Yeah, like beyond a level that’s difficult to understand and impossible to understand probably.

JOE ROGAN:
Somehow or another, so it’s almost like it’s a requirement for survival to achieve some sort of symbiotic existence with AI.

ELON MUSK:
It’s not a requirement. It’s just if you want to be along for the ride then you need to do some kind of symbiosis. So the way your brain works right now, you’ve got kind of like the animal brain, reptile brain, kind of like the lymphic system basically. You’ve got the cortex. Now the brain purist will argue with this definition, but essentially you’ve got the primitive brain and you’ve got the sort of smart brain or the brain that’s capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey can’t understand.

ELON MUSK:
Now your cortex is much, much smarter than your lymphic system. Nonetheless, they work together well. So I haven’t met anyone who wants to delete their lymphic system or their cortex. People are quite happy having both. So you can think of this as being like the computer, the AI is like a third layer, a tertiary layer. So that could be symbiotic with the cortex. It’d be much smarter than the cortex, but you essentially have three layers and you actually have that right now.

ELON MUSK:
Your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable of things that your brain is definitely not. Storing terabytes of information perfectly, doing incredible calculations that we couldn’t even come close to doing. You have that with your computer. It’s just like I said, the data rate is slow, the connection is weak.

JOE ROGAN:
Why is it so disconcerting or why does it not give me comfort to think about  Like when I think about a symbiotic connection to AI, I always think of this cold, emotionless sort of thing that we will become. Is that a bad way to look at it 

ELON MUSK:
I don’t think, that’s not how it would be. Like I said you already are symbiotic with AI or computers.

JOE ROGAN:
Phones, computers, laptops.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, there’s quite a bit of AI going on, artificial neural nets. Increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming more and more. So you are connected, if you use Google Voice or Alexa or one of those things, it’s using a neural net to decode your speech and try understand what you were saying.

ELON MUSK:
If you’re trying to do image recognition or improve the quality of photograph, the neural nets the best way to do that. So you are already sort of a cybernetic symbiote. Like I said, it’s just a question of your data rate. The communication speed between your phone and your brain is slow.

JOE ROGAN:
When do you think you’re going to do it  How long will you wait  Once it starts becoming available 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, if it works I’ll do it. Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Right away.

ELON MUSK:
I mean let’s make sure it works.

JOE ROGAN:
How do we make sure it works  We try it on prisoners  What do you do  Take rapists  Cut holes in their head 

ELON MUSK:
No, like I said, if somebody has got a serious brain injury and people that have very severe brain injuries and then you can fix those brain injuries. Then you prove out that it works and   expand and make more and more brain injuries, solve more and more. At a certain age we all are going to get Alzheimer’s or we’re all going to get senile. Then moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing.

ELON MUSK:
It’s like you said, okay, well this would allow you to remember your names of your kids and have a normal, a much more normal life where you were able to function much later in life. So I think essentially almost everyone would find a need at some point if you get old enough to use Neuralink. Then it’s like, okay, so we can improve the functionality and improve the communication speed. So then you will not have to use your thumbs to communicate with the computer.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you ever sit down and extrapolate  Do you ever sit down and think about all the different iterations of this and what this eventually leads to 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, sure. I Think about it a lot. Like I said, this is not something that’s going to sneak up on you. Getting FDA approval for this stuff is not overnight. I don’t know, we probably have to be on version 10 or something before it would realistically be a human AI symbiote situation. You’ll see it coming.

JOE ROGAN:
You see it coming, but when do you think it’s going to be  When you’re alone, if you have free time, I don’t know if you have free time, but if you just sit down and think about this iteration, the next onward, keep going and you drag it out with improvements along the way and leaps and bounds and technological innovations. Where do you see it  What are we going to be 

ELON MUSK:
Like when 

JOE ROGAN:
20, 25 years from now  What are we going to be 

ELON MUSK:
Well, assuming civilization is still around, it’s looking fragile right now. I think we could have, in 25 years probably I would think there could be a whole brain interface.

JOE ROGAN:
A whole brain interface 

ELON MUSK:
Something pretty close to that. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
What do you mean by whole brain interface 

ELON MUSK:
Almost all the neurons are connected to the sort of AI extension of yourself. If you want.

JOE ROGAN:
AI extension of yourself.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
What does that mean to you, when you say AI Extension of yourself 

ELON MUSK:
Well, like I said, you already have a computer extension of yourself and your phone and computers and stuff. So, and now online it’s like somebody dies, there’s like an online ghost that they’re still, their online stuff is still alive.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s a good way to put it. It is weird when you read someone’s tweets after they’re dead.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Instagram and their stories and yeah, whatever Facebook and stuff.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s a great way to put it. It’s like an online ghost. That’s very accurate.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. So it would just be that more of you would be in the cloud, I guess, than in your body or more of you.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa. Now, when you say civilization’s fragile, do you mean because of this COVID-19 shit that’s going on right now 

ELON MUSK:
What’s that  I never heard of it.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s this thing, it’s like some people just get a cough.

ELON MUSK:
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

JOE ROGAN:
Other people it gets much worse.

ELON MUSK:
Sure. Well, yeah. I mean this certainly has taken over the mind space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Well, out of nowhere. That’s what’s crazy. It’s like you go back to November, nothing. Now here we are, December, January, February, March, April, May, six months. Totally different world. So from nothing to, everything’s locked down. There’s so much conflicting information and conflicting opinions about how to proceed. What has happened, you find things where there was a meat packing plant, I believe in Missouri where 300 plus people were asymptomatic, tested positive or asymptomatic.

JOE ROGAN:
Then in other places it just ravages entire communities and kills people and it’s so weird. It almost appears, if you didn’t know any better, you’d be like, what  It seems like there’s a bunch of different viruses. It doesn’t seem like it’s the same thing or has a bunch of different reactions to the biological variety of people.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I mean I kind of saw this whole thing play out in China before it played out in the US. So it’s kind of like watching the same movie again, but in English. Yeah, I think the mortality rate is much less than what say the World Health Organization said it was. It’s much, much less. It’s like probably at least order of magnitude less.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, it seems to be very deadly to very specific kinds of people and people with specific problems.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, you can look at the mortality statistics by age and whether they have comorbidities, like do they have basically existing conditions and by age. If you’re below 60 and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low. It’s not zero, but it’s extremely low.

JOE ROGAN:
They didn’t think that this was the case though, when they first started to lock down the country. Do you think that it’s a situation where once they’ve proceeded in a certain way, it’s very difficult to correct course 

ELON MUSK:
It’s almost like people really wanted a panic. It’s quite crazy.

JOE ROGAN:
But in some places a panic is deserved, right  Like if you’re in the ICU in Manhattan and people are dying left and right and everyone’s on intubators. It seems like when you see all these people on ventilators and so many of them are dying and you see these nurses are dying and doctors are getting sick. In some places that fear is justified, but then in other places you’re reading these stories about hospitals that are essentially half empty. They’re having to furlough doctors and nurses because there’s no work for them.

ELON MUSK:
Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty. In some cases they’re at 30% capacity.

JOE ROGAN:
Is this because they’ve decided to forgo elective procedures and normal things that people would have to go to the hospital for 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I mean, we’re not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite important. Like you have a bad heart.

JOE ROGAN:
Gall bladder disease, yeah, sure.

ELON MUSK:
You need a triple bypass. It’s sort of elective, but if you don’t get it done in time, you’re going to die.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, elective is a weird word.

ELON MUSK:
Elective. It’s not like, this isn’t like plastic surgery.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, right.

ELON MUSK:
It’s more like my hip is, I’m in extreme pain because my hip’s blown out or my knee and I don’t want to go to the hospital. I can’t go to the hospital. People are in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, people that have quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear. So I think it’s a problem that’s not good.

JOE ROGAN:
It seems.

ELON MUSK:
So I think it’s a problem that’s not good.

JOE ROGAN:
It seems like the state of public perception is shifting.

ELON MUSK:
It is.

JOE ROGAN:
Like people are taking some deep breaths and relaxing and because of the statistics, essentially across the board it’s being recognized that it’s not as fatal as we thought it was. Still dangerous, still worse than a flu, but not as bad as we thought or we feared it could be.

ELON MUSK:
Objectively the mortality is much lower. At least a factor of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think that the current way we’re handling this, the social distancing, the mask, the locking down, does this make sense  Is it adequate  Or do you think that we should move back to at least closer to where we used to be 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I think proper hygiene is a good thing no matter what.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
Wash your hands and if you’re coughing, stay at home or wear a mask because it’s not good. They do that in Japan. That’s normal. If you’re ill you wear a face mask and you don’t cough on people. I think that would be a great thing to adopt in general throughout the world. Washing your hands is also good.

JOE ROGAN:
Well there’s a speculation why men get it more than women because men are disgusting. We don’t wash our hands as much.

ELON MUSK:
Men are disgusting it’s true. It’s bad.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s true, I admit it, we are all men in this room. We’re all gross.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Just go to the restroom you can see it’s horrible.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes we’re gross. My nine year old daughter yells at me, she goes, “Did you wash your hands ” She makes me go back and wash my hands. She’s right. Nine years old. If I had a nine year old boy do you think he would care  He wouldn’t give a fuck if I washed my hands.

ELON MUSK:
True. And I think that there’s definitely some silver linings here in improved hygiene and-

JOE ROGAN:
And awareness of potential.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I think this has shaken up the system. the system is somewhat moribund with lot of layers of bureaucracy and I think that we’ve cut through some of that bureaucracy. And at some point there probably will be a pandemic with a high mortality rate. Debate about like what’s high. but I mean something that’s killing a lot of 20 year olds, let’s say. Like if you had Ebola type of mortality.

JOE ROGAN:
Spanish flu, something that attacks the immune systems of healthy people.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Like killing large numbers of young healthy people, to find that as like a high mortality than that. This is at least practice for something like that. And I think there’s this, given it’s just a matter, that there will be eventually some such pandemic.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think that in a sense, the one good thing that we might get out of this is the realization that this is a potential reality  That we got lucky in the sense , I mean people that didn’t get lucky and died, of course I’m not disrespecting their death and their loss, but I’m saying overall as a culture, as a community, as a human race, as a community, this is not as bad as it could have been. This is a good dry run for us to appreciate that we need far more resources dedicated towards understanding these diseases, what to do in the case of pandemic, and much more money that goes to funding treatments and some preventative measures.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, absolutely. And I think there’s a good chance, it’s highly likely, I think, coming out of this that we will develop vaccines that we didn’t have before for coronaviruses, other viruses, and possibly cures for these. And our understanding of viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it’s received. So there’s definitely a lot of silver linings here.

JOE ROGAN:
Potentially, if we act correctly.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I think there will be a massive lining of here no matter what. Hopefully we can be more of a silver lining than less.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
So yeah, this is just kind of like a practice run for something that might in the future have a serious, like a really high mortality rate and we kind of got to go through this without it being something that kills vast numbers of young healthy people.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. When you made a series of tweets recently, I don’t remember the exact wording, but essentially you were saying, “Free America now.” Like, let’s open it back-

ELON MUSK:
That is the exact wording.

JOE ROGAN:
That is it  Thank you. How much do you pay attention to the response to that stuff and what was the response like  Did anybody go, “Hey man, what the fuck you doing ” Did anybody pull you aside 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, of course.

JOE ROGAN:
Who does that  Who gets to do that to you 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean, I certainly get that. There’s no shortage of negative feedback on Twitter. I get it.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh yeah. Twitter. Yeah, but I don’t read that. Do you read it.

ELON MUSK:
It’s a war zone.

JOE ROGAN:
You do sometimes though, right  You do read it 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, I scroll through the comments. Like I said, it’s a meme war zone.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, people knife you good and thorough.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s something I enjoy about it. Something about the freedom of expression that comes from all these people that do attack you. It’s like, if there was no vulnerability whatsoever, they wouldn’t attack you. And it’s like there’s something about these millions and millions of perspectives that you have to appreciate, even if it comes your way, even if the shit storm hits you in the face.

JOE ROGAN:
You got to appreciate, “Wow. How amazing is it that all these people do have the ability to express themselves ” I mean, you don’t necessarily want to be there when the shit hits you. You might want to get out of the way in anticipation of the shit storm, but the fact that so many people have the ability to reach out. And I think it’s in a lot of ways it’s a, I don’t want to say a misused resource, but it’s like giving monkeys guns.

JOE ROGAN:
They just start, “Da, da, da.” T`hey start gunning down things that are in front of them without any realization of what they’re doing. They have a rock, they see a window, they throw it. “Whoo, look at that. I got Elon mad. Look at that. This guy got mad at me. I fucking took this person down on Twitter. I got this lady fired. Oh, the fucking business is going under because of Twitter Wars.” It seems like there’s something about it that’s this new found thing that, I don’t want to say abuse, but just, I want to say that it’s almost like you hit the button and things blow up. You’re like, “Wow, what else can we blow up ”

ELON MUSK:
Sure. I mean, I’ve been in the Twitter war zone for, for a while here, so.

JOE ROGAN:
Twitter war zone.

ELON MUSK:
And it takes a lot to phase me at this point.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, that’s good too. Right  Like you develop a thick skin.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. You can’t take it personally. A lot of these people don’t actually know you. It’s like if you’re fighting a war and there’s like some opposing soldier that shoots at you, it’s not like they hate you. They don’t even know you.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
So just think of it like that. Like they have fire and bullets, whatever. But they don’t know you, so don’t take it personally.

JOE ROGAN:
There’s something interesting about it too. When you write something in 280 characters and they write something, it’s such a crude way. It’s like someone sending opposing smoke signals. Your smoke signals. It’s so crude. And especially when you’re talking about something like Neuralink. You’re talking about some future potential where you’re going to be able to express pure thoughts that get conveyed through some sort of a universal language with no ambiguity whatsoever versus tweets.

ELON MUSK:
Well, there will always be some ambiguity, but tweets, it’s hard. But maybe there should be like a sarcasm flag or something.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, right.

ELON MUSK:
Or a “just kidding” or-

JOE ROGAN:
It seems like it would take away some of the fun from people that know it’s sarcasm. Like if everybody knew that The Onion wasn’t, if you sent people articles. It was something about someone getting angry and an Onion article.

ELON MUSK:
Wow, that’s amazing.

JOE ROGAN:
You know what I mean  Where they don’t realize what it is. There’s something fun about that for everybody else.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I think it’s pretty great. It might be the best news source.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you know who Titania McGrath is  It’s Andrew Boyle. He’s a British fellow. Brilliant guy who’s been on the podcast before and he has this a fictional character, this a pseudonym Titania McGrath who’s like the ultimate social justice warrior.

ELON MUSK:
Is this, like, a female avatar.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
Oh, okay.

JOE ROGAN:
A female avatar that’s actually a computer conglomeration of a bunch of faces. It’s not really one person. So, one person can’t be a victim and be angry, but he’s sort of combined these faces to make this one perfect social justice warrior. But I recognized it early on before I met him. That this was parody. This was just fun. And then I love reading the people that don’t recognize that. They get angry. And there’s a lot of people that just get really furious. There’s some fun to that. There’s some fun to the not picking up on the true nature of the signal.

ELON MUSK:
I find Twitter quite engaging.

JOE ROGAN:
How do you have the time 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean like five minutes every couple of hours type thing. It’s not like I’m sitting on it all day.

JOE ROGAN:
But even five minutes every couple hours, if those are bad five minutes, they might be bouncing around your head for the next 30.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, you have to, like I said, take a certain amount of distance from  You read this and be like, “Okay, it’s bullets being fired by an opposing army.” Like I said, it’s not like they know you. Don’t take it personally.

JOE ROGAN:
Did you feel the same way when CNN had that stupid shit about ventilators with you  I found that both confusing and-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. That was annoying.

JOE ROGAN:
It was annoying.

ELON MUSK:
It was wrong.

JOE ROGAN:
What is also annoying as a person who reads CNN and wants to think of them as a responsible conveyor of the facts. I would like to think that-

ELON MUSK:
Well, yeah. I don’t think CNN is that.

JOE ROGAN:
I think used to be used to be.

ELON MUSK:
Used to be, yeah. What do you think’s the best source of just information out there 

JOE ROGAN:
That’s a good question.

ELON MUSK:
Let’s say you’re just the average citizen trying to just get the facts, figure out what’s going on. How to live your life and just looking for what’s going on in the world. It’s hard to find something that’s good.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Not trying to push some partisan angle, not trying to not doing sloppy reporting, and just aim it for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing. You’re just trying to figure out what’s going on. It’s like, I’m hard pressed. Where do you go 

JOE ROGAN:
I don’t know. I don’t think there’s any pure form. My favorite places are the New York times and the LA times and I don’t trust them a hundred percent. Because also, there’s individuals that are writing these stories. And that’s seems to be the problems, these individual biases and these individual, there’s purposely distorted perceptions, and then there’s ignorantly reported facts, and there’s so many variables. And you got to put everything through this filter of, “Where’s this person coming from  Did they have political biases  Did they have social biases  Are they upset because of their own shortcomings  And are they projecting this into the story ” It’s so hard.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I think maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and kind of following them as opposed to publication.

JOE ROGAN:
I go with whatever Matt Taibbi says.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
I trust him more than anybody.

ELON MUSK:
All right.

JOE ROGAN:
Matt Taibbi is onto something. As far as investigative reporters in particular, the way he reported the savings and loan crisis, the way he reports everything. I just listened to him above most above most. He’s my go to guy.

ELON MUSK:
All right. I’ll check it out.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, his Rolling Stone articles are amazing. His stuff on the savings and loan crisis, it’s just like, “What in the fuck ” And he’s not an economist by any stretch of the imagination. So he had to really deeply embedded himself in that world to try to understand it and to be able to report on it. And with also with a humorous flare.

ELON MUSK:
Now that’s nice.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
There’s not that many of them. It’s hard. And not a location where like, we are no bullshit. Wearenobullshit.com like the one place where you can say, “This is what we know, this is what we don’t know. This is what we think.” Not, “This person’s wrong and here’s why.” Like, ah, God damn it. I can’t. You don’t know. There’s a lot of stuff that is open to interpretation.

JOE ROGAN:
This particular coronavirus issue that we’re dealing with right now seems to be a great illuminator of that very fact. Is that there’s so much data. And there’s so much that’s open to interpret. There’s so many thing  because it’s all happening in real time. Right  And particularly right now in California, we’re in stage two Friday, two days from now. Stage two. Retail stores opening up.

JOE ROGAN:
Things are changing. Like, no one knows the correct process that needs to take place to save the most amount of lives, but yet ensure that our culture and that our economy survives. It’s a lot of speculation and guessing. But if you go to certain places, they’ll tell you, “We know why, and we know this, and we know ” Oh, it’s hard.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, in general I think we should be concerned about anything that’s a massive infringement on us. Civil liberties.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
So, you got to put a lot of weight on that. A lot of people died to win independence for the country and fight for the democracy that we have. And we should treasure that and not give up our liberties too easily. And I think we probably did that, actually. So.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, I like what you said when you said that it should be a choice and that to require people to stay home, require people to not go to work, and to arrest people for trying to make a living. This all seems wrong. And I think it’s a wrong approach. It’s an infantilization of the society. That daddy’s going to tell you what to do.

ELON MUSK:
Fundamentally a violation of the constitution. Freedom of assembly and it’s just, I don’t think these things stand up in court, really.

JOE ROGAN:
They’re arresting people for protesting because they’re protesting and violating social distancing, and these mandates that tell people that they have to stay home.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. These would definitely not stand up if the Supreme court  It’s obviously a complete violation of rights.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And again, this is not in any way disrespecting the people who have died from this disease. That’s certainly a real thing to think of.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean it just should be if you’re at risk, you should not be compelled to leave your house or leave a place of safety, but if you’re not at risk, or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life, you should have the right to do that.

JOE ROGAN:
And it seems like at this point in time, particularly, our resources would be best served protecting the people that are at risk versus penalizing the people that are not at high risk for living their life the way they did, particularly having a career, and making a living, and feeding your family, paying your bills, keeping your store open, keeping your restaurant open.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I mean, there’s a strong downside to this. So yeah, I just believe this is a free country. You should be allowed to do what you want as long as it does not endanger others.

JOE ROGAN:
But that’s the thing, right  This is the argument they will bring up. You are endangering others. You should stay home for the people that that, even if you’re fine, even if you know you’re going to be okay, there’s certain people that will not be okay because of your actions. They might get exposed to this thing that we don’t have a vaccine for, we don’t have a universally accepted treatment for, and then we need to  There’s two arguments, right 

JOE ROGAN:
One argument is we need to keep going, protect the weak, protect the sick, but let’s open up the economy. The other argument is stop placing money over human lives and let’s shelter in place until we come up with some sort of a decision and let’s figure out some way to develop some sort of a universal income, universal basic income plan, or something like that, to feed people during this time while we make this transition.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I think there’s a, as I said, my opinion is if somebody wants stay home, they should stay home. If somebody doesn’t want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home. That’s my opinion. If somebody doesn’t like that, well that’s my opinion. This notion though, that you can just sort of send checks out to everybody and things will be fine is not true.

ELON MUSK:
Obviously several have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty. Like it just makes stuff. There’s just a magic horn of plenty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of plenty. And then if somebody has more stuff than somebody else it’s because they took more from this magic horn of plenty. Now let me just break it to the fools out there.

ELON MUSK:
If you don’t make stuff, there’s no stuff. Yeah. So, if you don’t make the food, if you don’t process the food, you don’t transport the food, medical treatment, getting your teeth fixed, there’s no stuff. They’ve become detached from reality. You can’t just legislate money and solve these things. If you don’t make stuff, there is no stuff, obviously. we’ll run out of the stores, run out of the  the machine just grinds to a halt.

JOE ROGAN:
But the initial thought on this virus, the real fear was that this was going to kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, instantaneously in this country. It was going to do it very quickly if we didn’t hunker down, if we didn’t shelter in place, if we didn’t quarantine ourselves, or lock down. Do you think that the initial thought was a good idea based on the perception that this was going to be far more deadly than it turned out to be 

ELON MUSK:
Maybe. I think briefly.

JOE ROGAN:
Briefly 

ELON MUSK:
Briefly, but I think if any kind of sensible examination of what happened in China would lead you to conclusion that that is obviously not going to occur. This virus retreated in Wuhan. There’s was like, I don’t know, hundred thousand people a day leaving Wuhan. So, it went everywhere very fast throughout China, throughout the rest of the world, and the fatality rate was low.

JOE ROGAN:
Don’t you think though, it’s difficult to filter the information that’s coming out of China. To accurately, really get a real true representation of what happened. The propaganda machine is very strong. The World Health Organization appears to have been complicit with a lot of their propaganda.

ELON MUSK:
The thing is that American companies have massive supply chains in China. Like Tesla, for example. We have hundreds of suppliers. Like tier one, two, three, four suppliers throughout China. So, we know if they are able to make stuff or not. We know if they, if they have issues or not. China is back at full steam and pretty much every US company has some significant number of suppliers in China. So you know if they’re able to provide things or not or if there’s high mortality rate. Tesla has like 7,000 people in China. So, zero people died.

JOE ROGAN:
Mm-hmm  .

ELON MUSK:
Zero.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay. So that’s a real statistic that’s coming from-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. You know those people.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. We literally run payroll.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think there’s a danger of this  Yeah 

ELON MUSK:
I’m like-

JOE ROGAN:
Same folks are there

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Still there.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think there’s a danger of politicizing this  Where this becomes like opening up the country as Donald Trump’s, it’s his goal and then anything he does, there’s people that are going to oppose it and come up with some reasons why he’s wrong, particularly in this climate, where as we’re leading up to November and the 2020 elections. Do you think that this is a real danger in terms of public’s perception that Trump wants to open it up so they knee jerk oppose it because they oppose Trump 

ELON MUSK:
I think this has been politicized in both directions, really. Which is not great. Yeah. But like I said   I think there’s the question of where do civil liberties fit in this picture  And what can the government make you do, what can they make you not do, and what’s okay  And I think we went too far.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think it’s one of those things where once we’ve gone in this certain direction, it’s very difficult to make a correction  Make an adjustment to realize like, okay, we thought it was one thing. It’s not good, but it’s not what we thought it was going to be. It’s not what we feared, so let’s back up, and reconsider, and let’s do this publicly and say we were acting based on the information that we had initially. That information appears to be faulty and here’s how we move forward while protecting civil liberties, while protecting what essentially this country is founded on, which is a very agreed upon amount of freedom that we respect and appreciate.

ELON MUSK:
Absolutely. Well, I think we’re rapidly moving towards opening up the country. It’s going to happen extremely fast over the next few weeks. So, yeah. Something that would be helpful just to add from an informational level is when reporting Covid cases to separate out diagnosed with Covid versus had Covid like symptoms.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
Because the list of symptoms that could be Covid at this point is like a mile long. So, it’s hard to, if you’re ill at all it’s like you could recover it. So, just to give people better information. Definitely diagnosed with Covid or had Covid like symptoms. We’re conflating those two so that it looks bigger than it is. Then if somebody dies, was Covid a primary cause of the death or not  I mean, if somebody has Covid, gets eaten by a shark, we find their arm, their arm has Covid, it’s going to get recorded as a Covid death.

JOE ROGAN:
Is that real 

ELON MUSK:
Basically.

JOE ROGAN:
Not that bad, but heart attacks, strokes-

ELON MUSK:
You get hit by a bus.

JOE ROGAN:
Cancer.

ELON MUSK:
If you get hit by a bus, go to the of the hospital and die, and they find that you have Covid, you will be recorded as a Covid death.

JOE ROGAN:
Why would they do that though 

ELON MUSK:
Well right now, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I mean, it’s mostly paved with bad intentions, but there’s some good intentions   in there, too. And the stimulus bill that was intended to help with the hospitals that were being overwrought with Covid patients created an incentive to record something as Covid that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital’s going bankrupt for lack of other patients. So, the hospitals are in a bind right now. There’s a bunch of hospitals, they’re furloughing doctors, as you were mentioning. If your hospital’s half full, it’s hard to make ends meet. So now you’ve got like, “If I just check this box, I get $8,000. Put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000 back. Or, I got to fire some doctors.” So, this is tough moral quandary. It’s like, what are you going to do  That’s the situation we have.

JOE ROGAN:
What the way out of this  What do you think is, if you had the president’s ear, or if people wanted to just listen to you openly, what do you think is the way out of this 

ELON MUSK:
Let’s clear up the data. Clear up the data. So like I said, somebody should be recorded as Covid only if somebody has been tested. Has has received a positive, positive Covid test. Not if they simply have symptoms, one of like a hundred symptoms. And then if it is a Covid death, it must be separated. Was Covid a primary reason for death, or did they also have stage three cancer, or heart disease, emphysema, and got hit by bus and had Covid 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. I’ve read all this stuff about them diagnosing people as a Covid death despite other variables.

ELON MUSK:
This is not a question. This is what is occurring.

JOE ROGAN:
And where are you reading this from  Where are you getting this from 

ELON MUSK:
The public health officials have literally said this. This is not a question mark.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. But this is unprecedented, right  If someone had the flu but also had a heart attack, they would assume that that person died of a heart attack.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. So this is unprecedented. Is this because this is such a popular, I don’t want to use that word the wrong way, but that’s what I mean, popular subject  And financial incentives.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. And like I said, this is not some sort of a moral   of hospital administrators. It’s just, they’re in it. They’re in a tough spot here. They actually don’t have enough patients to pay everyone without furloughing doctors and firing staff. They’re running potentially going bankrupt. So then they’re like, “Okay, well the stimulus bill says we get all this money if it’s a Covid death.” I’m like, “Okay. They coughed before they died.” In fact, they’re not even diagnosed with Covid. If you had weakness, a cough, shortness of breath. Frankly, I’m not sure how you die without those things.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. There’s so many different things that you could attribute to Covid, too. There’s so many symptoms. There’s diarrhea, headaches, dehydration, cough.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. But to be clear, you don’t even need to have gotten a Covid diagnosis. You simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it’s Covid. So, then it makes the death count look very high and we’re then stuck in a bind because it looks like the death count’s super high and not going down like it should be. So then, we should keep whatever, keep the shelter in place stuff there, and keep people in their homes, confine people to homes. So we need to break out of this. We’re stuck in a loop. And I think the way to break out of this loop is to have clarity of information.

JOE ROGAN:
The clarity of information will certainly help, but altering perceptions, public perception, from people that are basically in a panic, there’s a lot of, essentially, well, at least a month ago-

JOE ROGAN:
 there’s a lot of, essentially  Well at least a month ago, we’re clearly in a panic. I mean, when you look around April 5th, April 6th, people were really freaking out. But here we are May, and May people are relaxing a little bit.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
They’re realizing like, “Hey, I actually know a couple of people that got it. It was just a cough,” and I know some people that got it where nothing happened.

ELON MUSK:
I know a lot of people who got it. I know zero people who died, but I know a lot of people that got it.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s not what we feared. We feared something much worse.

ELON MUSK:
That is correct.

JOE ROGAN:
So the adjustment’s difficult to make. So you said, first of all we need real data. We need-

ELON MUSK:
Just parse out the data. Don’t lump it all together. If you give people, just parse out the data better, clearer information about, like I said, was this an actual COVID diagnosis  Did they get the test and the test came back positive or do they just have some symptoms  Just parse those two out, and then parse out just, if somebody died, did they even have a COVID test or did they just have one of many symptoms. How do you die without weakness  I don’t know. It’s impossible, basically.

JOE ROGAN:
Of course. Yeah, it’s a good point.

ELON MUSK:
If you’re going to die, you’re going to have shortness of breath, weakness and you might cough a little.

JOE ROGAN:
So was it quantified  Was it 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, did that person, did they actually have a COVID test and the test come back positive  And then if they died, did they die where COVID was  It doesn’t have to be the main cause, but it was a significant contributor to their death or was it not a significant contributor to the death 

JOE ROGAN:
Right. It’s not as simple as just because you had COVID, covert, killed you.

ELON MUSK:
Definitely not.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, people die all the time and they have like flu and other colds and we don’t say that they died of those flu and other colds.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, that’s what’s so weird about this.

ELON MUSK:
It’s absurd.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s so popular and I use that word in a weird way, but it’s so popular that we’ve kind of forgotten people die of pneumonia every day.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
People die of  The flu didn’t take a break. “Oh, COVID’s got this. I’m going to sit this one out. I’m going to be on the bench. I’m going to wait until COVID’s done before I jump back into the game of killing people.” No, the flu is still here killing people.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, every year in the world, several hundred thousand people die directly of the flu.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Not tangentially.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Not every-

JOE ROGAN:
61,000 in this country last year.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. And we’re only 5% of the world.

JOE ROGAN:
And then there’s cigarettes.

ELON MUSK:
So, oh man, cigarettes. Now cigarettes will really kill you.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s a weird one. Right  We’re terrified of this disease that we’re projected. It could potentially kill 100,000 if not 200,000 Americans this year. But With cigarettes kill 500,000 and you don’t hear a peep out of any politician. There’s no one running for Congress that’s trying to ban cigarettes. There’s no one running for Senate that wants to put some education plan in place that’s going to stop cigarettes in their tracks.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, several years ago, or maybe longer, 10 years ago, I helped make a movie called Thank You for Smoking.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, I saw that.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It’s, it’s crazy. Barbecuing your lungs is just bad news. It’s not good. Turning your lungs into smoked beef, not great. So yeah. Tylenol, by the way, also kills a lot of people.

JOE ROGAN:
What is the number for Tylenol every year 

ELON MUSK:
I’m not sure the exact number. But until the opioid crisis, I believe Tylenol was the number one killer of all drugs.

JOE ROGAN:
Wow.

ELON MUSK:
Because basically, if you get drunk and take a lot of Tylenol, acetaminophen, essentially it causes liver failure. So people would like get wasted and then have a headache and then pop a ton of Tylenol, its curtains.

JOE ROGAN:
Wow.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Curtains is a funny word.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. But nobody’s, raging against Tylenol.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. It’s weird. Acceptable deaths are weird. And that’s the slippery slope about this. People shaming people for wanting to go back to work. “And other people are going to die.” Well, if you drive, do you drive    you should stop driving because people die from driving. So you, you definitely should fill up all the swimming pools because like 50 people die every day in this country from swimming. So let’s not swim anymore.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, water is really dangerous.

JOE ROGAN:
We need to chop down all the coconut trees.

ELON MUSK:
Stop water.

JOE ROGAN:
Coconuts kill 150 people every year.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Cut down all the coconut trees. We need those people.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s, at a certain point in time, it’s  Yeah, we’re vulnerable and also, we have a finite existence no matter what.

ELON MUSK:
We do. Nobody lives forever.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
I mean I think, you want to look at say deaths as like the, “but for this disease, whatever, they would have lived X number of years.”

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
So, if somebody dies when they’re 20 and could have lived till 80, they lost 60 years. But if somebody dies when they’re 80 and they might’ve lived till 81 they lost one year.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
So it’s, “How many life years were lost” is probably the right metric to use.

JOE ROGAN:
I don’t read my own comments, but I do read other people’s comments. And I was reading this one little Twitter beef that was going on where someone was saying that COVID takes an average of 10 years off people’s lives and we should appreciate those 10 years. And then someone else said-

ELON MUSK:
It’s not true.

JOE ROGAN:
I’m sure it’s not true.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah definitely not.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s the Twitter, it’s the world.

ELON MUSK:
Oh my god.

JOE ROGAN:
But someone else said “The average age of people who die from COVID is older than the average age people die.”

ELON MUSK:
Let’s just say, it’s about the same.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s a beautiful way of looking at it. I mean it’s unfortunate. It sucks, but it sucks if grandpa dies of Alzheimer’s or emphysema or leukemia. It sucks. It sucks when someone you love dies.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I mean actually, I think a lesson to be taken here that I think is quite important is that, if you have your grandparents and that they’re age of grandparents, really be careful with, any kind of flu or cold or something that that is not dangerous to kids or young adults, but is dangerous to the elderly. Basically, if your kid’s got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents, no matter what it is. There’re things where a young immune system has no problem, an older one has a problem. In fact a lot of the deaths are literally, it’s tragic, but they’re, they’re intra-family. It’s, the little kid had a cold or flu and they  .

JOE ROGAN:
Give it to grandpa.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. They had the family gathering. And they don’t know that this is a big deal. But it’s just important to remember when you get old, your immune system’s just not that strong. And so, just be careful with your loved ones who are elderly.

JOE ROGAN:
And I think there is some true objective understanding of the immune system and the ways to boost that immune system. And I really think that information should be distributed in a way, a nonjudgmental way, but like, “Look, this is a scientifically proven way that we can boost our immune system and it might save your life and it might save the life of your loved ones.” And maybe we could teach this to our grandparents and our parents and people that are vulnerable, vitamin C, heat shock proteins, all these different variables that we know contribute to a stronger immune system.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Actually, just a thing that is tough. As you get older, you tend to put on weight, certainly that’s happening with me. The older I get like, “Damn, sure harder to stay lean.” That’s for sure. And so, actually, being overweight is a big deal. It’s a fact. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
The New York hospital said it was the number one factor for severe COVID symptoms was obesity. That was the number one factor.

ELON MUSK:
That’s correct. It is, yes, exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
But it’s also, we live in a world where people want to be sensitive to other people’s feelings.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, absolutely.

JOE ROGAN:
So they don’t want to bring up the fact that being fat’s bad for you. It’s a judgmental on your 

ELON MUSK:
Food’s great.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
I do love food.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean to be totally frank, I mean, speaking for myself, I’d rather read tasty food and live a shorter life.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Those moments of enjoying a great meal.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And then even talking about it, they’re valuable. They’re worth something. Yeah. We don’t want to eat Soylent Green and live to be 160.

ELON MUSK:
No. Tasty food is great, it’s one of the best things about life.

JOE ROGAN:
It really is. Yeah. It’s an art form as well.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, absolutely.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s like fine food, it’s a delicious sandcastle. It’s temporary. It doesn’t last very long. But there’s something about it that’s very pleasing.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I don’t know what advice to give, maybe having tasty food but smaller amounts of it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. And I think, regulated feeding windows, really the way to go, some sort of an intermittent fasting approach.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
When I started doing that, I found myself to be quite a bit healthier. When I’ve deviated from that I’ve gained weight.

ELON MUSK:
So what 

JOE ROGAN:
16 hours 

ELON MUSK:
Well Okay, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
I like 16 hours. Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
So like at night or at a certain  

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. So I get to a certain point and then I count out, I usually hit the stopwatch on my phone and then I look at 15 hours, and I’m like “Oh, okay. Got an hour before I can eat.”

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And so anything in between that is just water or coffee.

ELON MUSK:
Actually, this may be a useful bit of advice for people, but eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep. And it can actually cause heartburn, that you don’t even know is happening, and that subtle heartburn, it affects your sleep because your horizontal and your body’s digesting. So if you want to improve the quality of your sleep and be healthier, it’s do not eat right before we go to sleep. It’s one of the worst things you could do.

JOE ROGAN:
Some of the biggest mistakes I’ve ever made. I’ve done that, particularly after comedy shows, if I’m starving, I’ll come home and I’ll eat. And then I go to bed and I just feel like shit and I wake up in the middle of the night.

ELON MUSK:
It’s going to crush your sleep and it’s going to damage your pyloric sphincter and your esophagus. In fact drinking and then going to sleep, that’s one of the worst things you could do.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
So just try to avoid drinking and eating-

JOE ROGAN:
Booze, drinking booze.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, exactly. Small amounts of alcohol, evidence suggests it doesn’t have a negative effect on-

JOE ROGAN:
I put it in the same category as delicious food. It kind of makes things a little more fun. I like it.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean some of the people who’ve lived the longest, there was a woman in France who I think, maybe has the record or close to it, and she had a glass of wine every day. Small amounts is fine. But yeah, I learned this like quite late in life. It’s like, just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep, and your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot.

JOE ROGAN:
For sure, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
It’s a big deal and I think, not widely known.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you have time to exercise 

ELON MUSK:
A little bit.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you have a trainer or anything 

ELON MUSK:
I do, although I haven’t seen him for a while. But yeah, especially if I’m out, say we’re working on Starship or something South Texas and I’m just living in my, I got a little house there in Boca Chica village, and I don’t have much to do, so. Or I’m working and I’ll just lift some weights or something. Some people love running, I don’t love running. But if-

JOE ROGAN:
What do you like to do exercise wise 

ELON MUSK:
To be totally frank, I wouldn’t exercise at all if I could. I prefer not to exercise, but if I’m going to exercise, I’ll lift some weights and then kind of run on a treadmill and maybe watch a show, if there’s a compelling show that pulls you in.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. Yeah. That’s a good thing to do. Watch a good movie or episode of Black Mirror or something like that, it’s great.

ELON MUSK:
Man, don’t watch Black Mirror before going to bed either.

JOE ROGAN:
Well don’t watch Black Mirror today. It’s too fucking accurate.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, exactly. It’s like, “Wait, that’s already happened in real life.”

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. They’re too close.

ELON MUSK:
It’s too close.

JOE ROGAN:
Well even  Jamie, didn’t you say that the guy who makes Black Mirror-

 
Today at  Oh my Mic’s off. Yeah he said it’s not a good time to start season six.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, he wants to hold off because reality-

ELON MUSK:
He’s nailed it 

JOE ROGAN:
 is black mirror.

ELON MUSK:
Oh man.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s like he’s going to have to reassess and attack it from a different angle. you should try something that’s fun to do. That’s not just, like learn a martial art or something like that.

ELON MUSK:
I did martial arts when I was kid. Liked it.

JOE ROGAN:
Did you  What’d you do 

ELON MUSK:
I did a TaeKwonDo. I did Karate,  .

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, alright, cool.

ELON MUSK:
And Judo.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, so you really branched out.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. And did Brazilian Jujitsu briefly.

JOE ROGAN:
Did you  Where 

ELON MUSK:
In Palo Alto.

JOE ROGAN:
Really 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh no shit. I was going to suggest that. That’s a great thing for people. That’s a thing about jujitsu, if you look at it from the outside you think, “Oh bunch of meatheads strangling each other.”

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
But they’re some of the smartest people I know, are jujitsu fiends because, first of all, they get introduced to it because usually either they want to exercise or learn some self-defense, but then they realize that it’s essentially like a language with your body. Like you’re having an argument with someone with some sort of a physical language. And it’s really complex and the more access to vocabulary and the sharper your words are, the more you’ll succeed in these ventures. That’s really an accurate analogy of what jujitsu is.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, I kind of got, probably like a lot of people, for the way-early day, the first MMA fights and Royce Gracie, and he was just like incredible. And it was like-

JOE ROGAN:
Technique.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. He was winning against people way bigger and that kind of thing. And it was just like “Whoa, this is cool.”

JOE ROGAN:
It was what martial arts were supposed to be, when we were kids. When you saw Bruce Lee fuck-up all these big giant guys. Like, “Wow, martial arts allow you to beat someone far bigger and stronger than you.”

ELON MUSK:
Right.

JOE ROGAN:
Most of the time that’s not real.

ELON MUSK:
Especially if they know martial arts too. It’s like, “Oh no.”

JOE ROGAN:
Yes. But in the UFC, when Royce Gracie, off of his back, was strangling Dan Severn with his legs. You’re like, “Holy shit, this guy’s being pinned by this big giant wrestler, and he wraps his legs around his neck, and chokes him to the point that guy has to surrender.” Amazing.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it was amazing. I mean Royce got beaten up pretty bad in some of those.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, he definitely had some rough fights-

ELON MUSK:
But he won.

JOE ROGAN:
He won. Yeah. He’s a legend. But what it showed, I mean I’m a huge lover of jujitsu, what it showed is that there is a method for diffusing these situations with technique and knowledge. And I think it’s also a great way to exercise too because it’s almost like the exercise is secondary to the learning of the thing. The exercise is like you want to develop strength and conditioning just so that you could be better at doing the thing. And the analogy that I use is, imagine if you had a race car and you could actually give the race car better handling and more horsepower just from your own focus and effort. That’s really what it’s like.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, totally.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. When am I going to be able to-

ELON MUSK:
My kids  I should say, I sent my kids to jujitsu since they were like, I don’t know, six.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, really 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, that’s awesome.

ELON MUSK:
 . Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s a great thing to learn. It really is.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, seems like a good  Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Maybe something like  mean even if you just have someone who holds the pads for you, you could get a workout in and it’d be fun.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
When am I going to be able to buy one of them roadsters  When’s that happening 

ELON MUSK:
Well I can’t say exactly when, but we got to get it  This COVID thing’s kind of thrown us for a loop.

JOE ROGAN:
I’m sure.

ELON MUSK:
So, not to blame everything on COVID, but it’s certainly set us back on progress for some number of months. But I mean things were going to get done. Ahead of Roadster are, ramping up model Y production, that’ll be a great car, it is a great car, getting the Berlin Giga-factory built, and also building Y getting expanding the Shanghai factory, which is going great and get this Cybertruck, Semi truck, Roadster. Roadster is kind of like dessert. We gotta get the meat and potatoes and greens and stuff.

JOE ROGAN:
But Roadster comes before cyber truck 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, I think we should do Cybertruck first, before Roadster.

JOE ROGAN:
Interesting.

ELON MUSK:
Now some of the-

JOE ROGAN:
I’m not mad at that.

ELON MUSK:
Some of the things for Roadster, the tri-motor, plaid powertrain, we’re going to have that in model S. So that’s like part one of the ingredients that’s needed for Roadster, is the plaid powertrain, the more advanced battery pack. That kind of thing.

JOE ROGAN:
I wanted to ask you about this before I forgot. There’s a company that’s called Apex is taking your Teslas and they’re giving it a wider base and wider tires and a little bit more advanced suspension.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
How do you feel about that 

ELON MUSK:
Sounds good to me, sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you work with them  Are you cool with those people 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I mean, go ahead.

JOE ROGAN:
They’re jazzing stuff up with carbon fiber and doing a bunch of interior choices. You’re cool with  You can’t fuck with that. You don’t have time. So is it good that someone comes along and has that sort of specialty operation 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I’ve got no problem.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s what it’s called, right  It’s like  Jamie, is it called Apex 

 
Yeah. I got a Unplugged Performance S-APEX.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s right. Unplugged Performance. Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. You could for sure, lighten the car up and improve tire traction and-

JOE ROGAN:
Have you seen that company’s stuff  What they do 

ELON MUSK:
I don’t know specifically, but there’s-

JOE ROGAN:
It’s pretty dope. They make it pretty dope looking  They take model S and they widen it and give it a bunch of carbon fiber. That’s it, right there.

ELON MUSK:
Cool.

JOE ROGAN:
Ooh-la-la, look at that.

ELON MUSK:
That looks pretty nice.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it does. Now, the plaid version of the model S, are you going to widen the track and do a bunch of different, I know you guys are testing at the Nurburgring. Can you not talk about that 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I think we’ve got to leave that for a proper sort of product unveil.

JOE ROGAN:
I understand.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
I understand. Last time you were here you convince me to buy a Tesla. I bought it and it’s fucking insane.

ELON MUSK:
Oh great. Glad you like it.

JOE ROGAN:
Aw Man.

ELON MUSK:
Pretty fun.

JOE ROGAN:
I don’t  It’s not just pretty fun. The way I’ve described it is, it makes other cars seem stupid. They just seem dumb. And I love dumb things. I love dumb cars. Like I love campfires. I love campfires. I have a 1993 Porsche that’s air cooled.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s not that fast. It’s really slow compared to the Tesla really.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, actually, it’s really quite slow. But, okay, sure.

JOE ROGAN:
But there’s something engaging about the mechanical, just like the gears and, it’s very analog. But it’s so stupid in comparison to the Tesla. Like when I want to go somewhere in the model S, I hit the gas and it just goes, whee. It just, it like violates time.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
You’ve tried it like Ludicrous Plus and stuff like that 

JOE ROGAN:
Oh yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Cool.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Oh yeah.

ELON MUSK:
We just did a software update where it’ll do, like a, cheetah stance. So yeah. So, because it’s got a dynamic air suspension so it lowers the back.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh Jesus.

ELON MUSK:
Just like a sprinter basically.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Like what do you do if you’re a sprinter, you hunker down and then shoo. So I shaved like a 10th of a second off the 0 to 60. I mean it’s pretty fun.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s so  I’ve taken so many people. And, I take them for the Holy shit moment. I’m like, “You ready ” like “Hang on there.” and then I stomp on the gas-

ELON MUSK:
And they’ve never felt anything like it.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s confusing.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It really is.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
The instant torque and just the sheer acceleration is baffling.

ELON MUSK:
It’s baffling.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s baffling.

ELON MUSK:
They’ve never felt it.

JOE ROGAN:
No.

ELON MUSK:
It’s faster than falling.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s crazy. It’s so fast. It’s a roller coaster. And my family yells at me when I stomp the gas. Like I tell my kids, I’m like, “You want to feel it  You want to feel it ” they’re like “Do it, do it, do it.” my wife’s like, “Don’t do it.” Boom. And even if I just do it on the highway for a couple of seconds, it’s very exciting.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, pretty fun.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s very fun.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It’s like having your own roller coaster on tap.

JOE ROGAN:
It really is like a roller coaster on tap. Without the loop de loops. But, the pinning to your seat, it seems like you’re not supposed to be able to experience that from some sort of a consumer vehicle that a regular person could buy, if you have the money. It seems too crazy. And then the idea that this Roadster is a half of a second faster than that  That’s madness.

ELON MUSK:
Well with a Roadster, we’re going to do some things that are kind of unfair. So we’re going to take some things from Cadillac rocket world and put them on a car, so.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, I’ve read about that. Explain that. Like what do you 

ELON MUSK:
Well, like I said, we can’t do the product unveil right here. But, it’s going to do some things that are unfair.

JOE ROGAN:
Unfair.

ELON MUSK:
When we do the unveil of the Roadster, let me just say that anyone who’s been waiting, they won’t be sorry. They won’t be sorry.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, but sure, well anything that goes 0 to 60, what is it 1.9  Is that the 0 to 60 

ELON MUSK:
That’s the base model.

JOE ROGAN:
What’s the top of the food chain model 

ELON MUSK:
 .

JOE ROGAN:
Okay. Faster than that. Let’s just say faster than that.

ELON MUSK:
Faster than that, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
That seems so crazy to me. Now, what was it like when the dude threw the steel balls at the window and they were supposed to not break, and it broke 

ELON MUSK:
Well, yeah. I mean-

JOE ROGAN:
I know, extenuating circumstances.

ELON MUSK:
 at least you know that our demos are authentic, because I was not expecting that and then I think I muttered, under my breath, like “Holy shit”.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. You didn’t get mad though.

ELON MUSK:
No-

JOE ROGAN:
You didn’t Steve jobs it.

ELON MUSK:
No, I definitely swore, I didn’t think the micro pick it up but it did. But, so like we practiced this, behind the scenes. At Tesla, we don’t do like tons of practice for our demos, because we’re working on the cars. We’re building new technologies and improving the fundamental product. So we’re not spending, doing hundreds of practice things or anything like that. We don’t have time for that. But, just hours before the demo, both Franz, head of design and I were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window, and it’s bouncing right off. And like, “Okay, this seems pretty good. It seems like we got it.” Okay  And then, we think what happened was, when Franz hit the door with the sledgehammer-

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
 show, this is exoskeleton, high strength, hardened steel. You can literally wind up with a sledgehammer, full on double-handed sledgehammer and hit the door and there’s not even a dent. It’s cool. But we think that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom and then, once you crack the corner of the glass it’s game over. So then when you threw the ball that’s what cracked the glass.

JOE ROGAN:
So in hindsight-

ELON MUSK:
It didn’t go through though.

JOE ROGAN:
It didn’t go through.

ELON MUSK:
It’s doesn’t go through.

JOE ROGAN:
That’s true. It didn’t shatter the whole thing, like a regular window would either, which would just dissolve. Right  So in hindsight, the ball should have been first, sledgehammer second.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
You live, you learn.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
Listen, man, we’ve taken up a lot of your time. You had a child recently.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I got to get back to it.

JOE ROGAN:
It’s amazing that you had the time to come down here. And I really appreciate that. I appreciate everything you do, man. I’m glad you’re out there. And I really appreciate you coming down here and sharing your perspective.

ELON MUSK:
Well, I think you’ve got a great show. Thanks for having me on.

JOE ROGAN:
Thank you. My pleasure.

ELON MUSK:
All right.

JOE ROGAN:
Elon Musk, ladies and gentlemen. Good night.

ELON MUSK:
Anyway, that should get a little play.


JOE ROGAN:
Ah, ha, ha, ha. Four, three, two, one, boom. Thank you. Thanks for doing this, man. Really appreciate it.

ELON MUSK:
You're welcome.

JOE ROGAN:
It's very good to meet you.

ELON MUSK:
Nice to meet you too.

JOE ROGAN:
And thanks for not lighting this place on fire.

ELON MUSK:
You're welcome. That's coming later.

JOE ROGAN:
How does one, just in the middle of doing all the things you do, create cars, rockets, all the stuff you're doing, constantly innovating,
decide to just make a flamethrower  Where do you have the time for that 

ELON MUSK:
Well, the flame, we didn't puta lot of time into the flamethrower. This was an off-the-cuff thing. It's sort of a hobby company called
the Boring Company, which started out as a joke, and we decided to make a real, and dig a tunnel under LA. And then, other people
asked us to dig tunnels. And so, we said yes in a few cases.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, who-

ELON MUSK:
And then, we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time. And we started off with a cap. And there
was only one thing on, which is BoringCompany.com/hat. That's it. And then, we sold the hats, limited edition. It just said, "The
Boring Company."

ELON MUSK:
And then, I'm a big fan ofSpaceballs, the movie. And in Spaceballs, Yogurt goes through the merchandising section, and they have
a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs. And, like, the kids love that one. That's the line when he pulls up the
flamethrower. It's like, "We should do a flamethrower." So, we-

JOE ROGAN:
Does anybody tell you no  Does anybody go, "Elon, maybe for yourself, but selling a flamethrower, the liabilities, all the people
you're selling this device to, what kind of unhinged people are going to be buying a flamethrower in the first place  Do we reallywant
to connect ourselves to all these potential arsonists 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it's a terrible idea. It's terrible. Don't buy one. I said, "Don't buy this flamethrower. Don't buy it. Don't buy it." That's what I said,
but, still, people bought it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
There's nothing I can do to stop them. I did not stop them.

JOE ROGAN:
You build it, they will come.

ELON MUSK:
I said, "Don't buy it. It's a bad idea."

JOE ROGAN:
How many did you make 

ELON MUSK:
It's dangerous. It's wrong. Don't buy it. And, still, people bought it. I just couldn't stop them.

JOE ROGAN:
How many did you make 

ELON MUSK:
20,000.

JOE ROGAN:
And they're all gone 

ELON MUSK:
In three   I think, four days. They sold out in four days.

JOE ROGAN:
Are you going to do another run 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
No, that's it 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, I see.

ELON MUSK:
I said we're doing 20. We did 50,000. 50,000 hats, and that was a million dollars. I thought, "Okay. Well, we'll sell something for 10
million," and that was 20,000 flamethrowers at $500 each. They went fast.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. How do you have the time  How do you have the timeto do that though  I mean, I understand that it's not a big deal in terms
of all the other things you do, but how do you have time to do anything  I just   I don'tunderstand your time management skills.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, I didn't spend much time on this flamethrower. I mean, to be totally frank, it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle
cover. It's not a real flamethrower.

JOE ROGAN:
Which is why it says, "Not a flamethrower."

ELON MUSK:
That's why we were very clear, this is not actually a flamethrower. And, also, we are told that various countries would ban shipping of
it, that they would ban flamethrowers. So, we're very   To solve this problem for all of the customs agencies, we labeled it, "Not a
flamethrower."

JOE ROGAN:
Did it work  Was it effective 

ELON MUSK:
I don't know. I think so. Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
So far.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, but you do-

ELON MUSK:
Because they said you cannot ship a flamethrower.

JOE ROGAN:
But you do so many different things. Forget about the flamethrower. Like, how do you do all that other shit  Like, how does one
decide to fix LA traffic by drilling holes in the ground  And who do you even approach with that  Like, when you have this idea, who
do you talk to about that 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, I'm not saying it's going to be successful or something, you know. It's not like asserting that it's going to be successful. But so
far, I've lived in LA for 16 years, and the traffic has always been terrible. And so, I don't see any other, like, ideas for improving the
traffic. So, in desperation, we're going to dig a tunnel. And maybe that tunnel will be successful and maybe it won't.

JOE ROGAN:
I'm listening.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I'm not trying to convince you it's going to work.

JOE ROGAN:
And are the people that you-

ELON MUSK:
I mean, or anyone.

JOE ROGAN:
But you are starting this though. This is actually a project you're starting to implement, right.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah, no. We've dug about a mile. It's quite long. It takes a long time to walk it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Now, when you're doing this, what is the ultimate plan  The ultimate plan is to have these in major cities, and anywhere there's
mass congestion, and just try it out in LA first 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It's in LA because I mostly live in LA. That's the reason. It's a terrible place to dig tunnels. This is one of the worst places to dig
tunnels mostly because of the paperwork. You all think it's like, "What about seismic " It's like, actually, both tunnels are very safe in
earthquakes.

JOE ROGAN:
Why is that 

ELON MUSK:
Earthquakes are essentially a surface phenomenon. It's like waves on the ocean. So, if there's a storm, you want to be in a
submarine. So, being in a tunnel is like being in a submarine. Now, the way the tunnel is constructed, it's constructed out of these
interlocking segments, kind of like a snake. It's sort of like a snake exoskeleton with double seals.

ELON MUSK:
And so, even when the ground moves, the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake, and it
doesn't crack or break. And it's extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken. And it's capable of taking five atmospheres of
pressure. It's waterproof, methane-proof, well, gas-proof of any kind, and meets all California seismic requirements.

JOE ROGAN:
So, when you have this idea, who do you bring this to 

ELON MUSK:
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, you're implementing it. So, you're digging holes in the ground.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Like, you have to bring it to someone that lets you do it.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. There are some engineers from SpaceX who thought it would be cool to do this. And the guy who runs it, like, day-to-day is
Steve Davis. He's a longtime SpaceX engineer. He is great. So, Steve was like, "I'd like to help make this happen." I was like, "Cool."
So, we started off with digging a hole in the ground. It's got like a permit for a pit, like pit, and just dug a big pit.

JOE ROGAN:
And you have to tell them what the pit's for, or you just said, "Hey, we just want to diga hole."

ELON MUSK:
I just filled up this form.

JOE ROGAN:
That's it 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it was a pit in our parking lot.

JOE ROGAN:
But do you have to give them some sort of a blueprint for your ultimate idea  And do they have to approve it  Like, how does that
work 

ELON MUSK:
Now. We just started off with a pit.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
A big pit. And, you know, it's not really   Youknow, they don't really care about the existential nature of a pit. You just say like, "I
want a pit."

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. And it's a hole in the ground. So then, we got the permit for the pit, and we dug the pit, and we dug it in, like, I don't know, three
days, two to three days. Actually, I think two, 48hours, something like that because Eric Carr said he was coming by for the Hype.
He's going to attend the Hyperloop Competition. which is like a student competition we have for who can make the fastest part in the
Hyperloop. And he was coming.

ELON MUSK:
The finals are going to be on Sunday afternoon. And so, Eric is coming by on Sunday afternoon. He's like,"You know, we should dig
this pit, and then like show Eric." So, this was like Friday morning. And then, yeah. So, it's about a little over 48 hours later, we dug
the pit. There was like wind 24/7. Oh, 24. 48 straight hours, something like that. And dug this big pit, and we're like, "Show Eric the
pit." It's like, obviously, it's just a pit. But, hey, a hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground.

JOE ROGAN:
And what did you tell him aboutthis pit  I mean, you just said this is the beginning of this idea.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
We're going to build tunnels under LA to help funnel traffic better.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And they just go, "Okay." But we've joked around about this in the podcast before to like what if a person can go to the people that
run the city and go, "Hey, I want to dig some holes on the ground and put some tunnels in there," and they go "Oh, yeah, okay."

ELON MUSK:
Not the only one with a holein the ground.

JOE ROGAN:
But it's a-

ELON MUSK:
People dig holes in the ground all time.

JOE ROGAN:
But my question is, like, I know how much time you must be spending on your Tesla factory. I know how much time you must be
spending on SpaceX. And yet, you still have time to dig holes under the ground in LA, and come up with these ideas, and then
implement them. Like-

ELON MUSK:
I have a million ideas.

JOE ROGAN:
I'm sure you do.

ELON MUSK:
There's no shortage of that. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
I just don't know how you manage your time. I don't understand it. It doesn't seem   It doesn't even seemhumanly possible.

ELON MUSK:
You know, I do, basically   I think, people, like, don't totally understand what I do with my time. They think, like, I'm a business guy or
something like that. Like my Wikipedia page says business magnate.

JOE ROGAN:
What would you call yourself 

ELON MUSK:
A business magnet. Can someone please change my Wikipedia page to magnet 

JOE ROGAN:
They'll change it for you.

ELON MUSK:
Please change.

JOE ROGAN:
Right now, it's probably already changed.

ELON MUSK:
It's locked. So, somebody has to be able to unlock it and change it to magnet.

JOE ROGAN:
Someone will get that.

ELON MUSK:
I want to be a magnet. No, I do engineering, you know, and manufacturing, and that kind of thing. That's like 80% or more of my time.

JOE ROGAN:
Ideas, and then the implementation of those ideas.

ELON MUSK:
Those are like hardcore engineering, like-

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
 designing things, you know.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
It's structural, mechanical, electrical, software, user interface, engineering, aerospace engineering.

JOE ROGAN:
But you must understand there's not a whole lot of human beings like you. You know that, right  You're an oddity-

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
 to chimps like me.

ELON MUSK:
We're all chimps.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, we are.

ELON MUSK:
We're one notch. One notch above a chimp.

JOE ROGAN:
Some of us are a little more confused. When I watch you doing all these things, I'm like, "How does this motherfucker have all this
time, and all this energy, and all these ideas, and then people just let him do these things "

ELON MUSK:
Because I'm an alien.

JOE ROGAN:
That's what I've speculated.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Then, I'm on record saying this in the past. I wonder.

ELON MUSK:
It's true.

JOE ROGAN:
I mean, if therewas one  I was like, "Ifthere was, like, maybe an intelligent being that we created, you know, like some AI creature
that's superior to people, maybe it's just hanging around with us for a little while like you've been doing, and then fix a bunch of shit."
I mean, that's the way.

ELON MUSK:
I might have some mutationor something like that.

JOE ROGAN:
You might. Do you think you do 

ELON MUSK:
Probably.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you wonder  Like, around normal people, you're like, "Hmm." Think, "What's up with these boring dumb motherfuckers " ever 

ELON MUSK:
Not bad for a human, but, I think, I will not be able to hold a candle to AI.

JOE ROGAN:
You scared the shit out of me when you talk about AI between you and Sam Harris.

ELON MUSK:
Oh sure.

JOE ROGAN:
I didn't consider it until I had a podcast with Sam once.

ELON MUSK:
That's great.

JOE ROGAN:
And he made me shit my pants. Talking about AI, I realized, like, "Oh, this is a genie that once it's out of the bottle, you're never
getting it back in."

ELON MUSK:
That's true.

JOE ROGAN:
There was a video that you tweeted about one of those Boston dynamic robots.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And you're like,"In the future, it will be moving so fast, you can't see it without a strobe light."

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. You can probably do that right now.

JOE ROGAN:
And no one's really paying attention too much other than people like you, or people that are really obsessed with technology, all these
things are happening. And these robots are   Doyou see the one where PETA put out a statement that you shouldn't kick robots 

ELON MUSK:
It's probably not wise.

JOE ROGAN:
For retribution.

ELON MUSK:
Their memory is very good.

JOE ROGAN:
I bet it's really good.

ELON MUSK:
It's really good.

JOE ROGAN:
I bet it is.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And getting better every day.

ELON MUSK:
It's really good.

JOE ROGAN:
Are you honestly legitimately concerned about this  Are you   Is, like,AI one of your main worries in regards to the future 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. It's less of a worry than it used to be, mostly due to taking more of a fatalistic attitude.

JOE ROGAN:
So, you used to have more hope, and you gave up some of it. And, now, you don't worry as much about AI. You're like, "This is just
what it is."

ELON MUSK:
Pretty much. Yes, yes, yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Was that not  Yes but no.

ELON MUSK:
It's not necessarily bad. It's just it's definitely going to be outside of human control.

JOE ROGAN:
Not necessarily bad, right 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. It's not necessarily bad. It's just outside of human control. Now, the thing that's going to be tricky here is that it's going to be very
tempting to use AI as a weapon. It's going to be very tempting. In fact, it will be used as a weapon. So, the on ramp to serious AI, the
danger is going to be more humans using it against each other, I think, most likely. That will be the danger. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
How far do you think we are from something that can make its own mind up whether or not something's ethically or morally correct,
or whether or not it wants to do something, or whether or not it wants to improve itself, or whether or not it wants to protect itself from
people or from other AI  How far away are we from something that's really truly sentient 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean, you could argue that any group of people, like a company is essentially a cybernetic collective of people and machines.
That's what a company is. And then, there are different levels of complexity in the way these companies are formed. And then,
there's a sort of like a collective AI in the Google, sort of, Search, Google Search, you know, where we're all sort of plugged in as like
nodes on the network, like leaves on a big tree.

ELON MUSK:
And we're all feeding this network with our questions and answers. We're all collectively programming the AI. And Google Plus, all
the humans that connect to it, are one giant cybernetic collective. This is also true of Facebook, and Twitter, and Instagram, and all
the social networks. They're giant cybernetic collectives.

JOE ROGAN:
Humans and electronics all interfacing, and constantly now, constantly connected.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, constantly.

JOE ROGAN:
One of the things that I've been thinking about a lot over the last few years is that one of the things that drives a lot of people crazy is
how many people are obsessed with materialism and getting the latest greatest thing. And I wonder how much of that is   Well, a lot
of it is most certainly fueling technology and innovation. And it almost seems like it's built into us. It's like what we like and what we
want that we're fueling this thing that's constantly around us all the time.

JOE ROGAN:
And it doesn't seem possible that people are going to pump the brakes. It doesn't seem possible at this stage where we're constantly
expecting the newest cellphone, the latest Tesla update, the newest MacBook Pro. Everything has to be newer and better. And that's
going to lead to some incredible point. And it seems like it's built into us. It almost seems like it's an instinct that we're working
towards this, that we like it. Our job, just like the ants build the anthill, our job is to somehow know how fuel this.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I mean, I made this commentsome years ago, but it feels like we are the biological bootloader for AI. Effectively, we are
building it. And then, we're building progressively greater intelligence. And the percentage of intelligence that is not human is
increasing. And, eventually, we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence. But the AI is informed strangely by the human
limbic system. It is, in large part, our id writ large.

JOE ROGAN:
How so 

ELON MUSK:
We mentioned all those things, the sort of primal drives. There's all of the things that we like, and hate, and fear. They're all there on
the internet. They're a projection of our limbic system. That's true.

JOE ROGAN:
No, it makes sense. And the thinking of it as a   I mean, thinking of corporations, and just thinking of just human beings
communicating online through these social media networks in some sort of an organism that's a   It's a cyborg. It's a combination.
It's a combination of electronics and biology.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. This is   In somemeasure, like, it's to thesuccess of these online systems. It's sort of a function of how much limbic
resonance they're able to achieve with people. The more limbic resonance, the more engagement.

JOE ROGAN:
Whereas, like one of the reasons why probably Instagram is more enticing than Twitter.

ELON MUSK:
Limbic resonance.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. You get moreimages, more video.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
It's tweaking your system more.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you worry or wonder, in fact, of what the next step is  I mean, a lotof you didn't see Twitter coming. You know, communicate with
140 characters or 280 now would be a thing that people would be interested in. Like it's going to excel. It's going to become more
connected to us, right 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Things are getting more and more connected. They're, at this point, constrained by bandwidth. Our input/output is slow,
particularly output. Output got worse with thumbs. You know, we used to have input with 10 fingers. Now, we have thumbs. But
images are just, also, other way of communicating at high bandwidth. You take pictures and you send pictures to people. What
sends, that communicates far more information than you can communicate with your thumb.

JOE ROGAN:
So, what happened with you where you decided, or you took on a more fatalistic attitude  Like, was there any specific thing, or was it
just the inevitability of our future 

ELON MUSK:
I try to convince people to slow down. Slow down AI to regulate AI. That's what's futile. I tried for years, and nobody listened.

JOE ROGAN:
This seems like a scene in a movie-

ELON MUSK:
Nobody listened.

JOE ROGAN:
 where the the robots are going to fucking takeover.You're freaking me out. Nobody listened 

ELON MUSK:
Nobody listened.

JOE ROGAN:
No one. Are people more inclined to listen today  It seems like an issue that's brought up more often over the last few years than it
was maybe 5-10 years ago. It seemed like science fiction.

ELON MUSK:
Maybe they will. So far, they haven't. I think, people don't   Like, normally, the waythat regulations work is very slow. it's very slow
indeed. So, usually, it will be something, some new technology. It will cause damage or death. There will be an outcry. There will be
an investigation. Years will pass. There will be some sort of insights committee. There will be rule making. Then, there will be
oversight, absolutely, of regulations. This all takes many years. This is the normal course of things.

ELON MUSK:
If you look at, say, automotive regulations, how long did it take for seatbelts to be implemented, to be required  You know, the auto
industry fought seatbelts, I think, for more than a decade. It successfully fought any regulations on seatbelts even though the
numbers were extremely obvious. If you had seatbelts on, you would be far less likely to die or be seriously injured. It was
unequivocal. And the industry fought this for years successfully. Eventually, after many, many people died, regulators insisted on
seatbelts. This is a   This time frame is not relevant to AI. You can't take 10 years from a point of which it's dangerous. It's too late.

JOE ROGAN:
And you feel like this is decades away or years away from being too late. If you have this fatalistic attitude, and you feel like it's going
  We're in an almost like a doomsday countdown.

ELON MUSK:
It's not necessarily a doomsday countdown. It's a-

JOE ROGAN:
Out of control countdown 

ELON MUSK:
Out of control, yeah. People quote the singularity, and that's probably a good way to think about it. It's a singularity. It's hard to
predict like a black hole, what happens past the event horizon.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. So, once it's implemented, it's very difficult because it would be able to-

ELON MUSK:
Once the genie is out of the bottle, what's going to happen 

JOE ROGAN:
Right. And it will be able to improve itself.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
That's where it gets spooky, right  The idea that it can do thousands of years of innovation very, very quickly.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And, then, it will be just ridiculous.

ELON MUSK:
Ridiculous.

JOE ROGAN:
We will be like this ridiculous biological shitting, pissing thing trying to stop the gods. "No, stop. We're like living with a finite lifespan,
and watching, you know, Norman Rockwell paintings."

ELON MUSK:
It could be terrible, and it could be great. It's not clear.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
But one thing is for sure, we will not control it.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think that it's likely that we will merge somehow or another with this sort of technology, and it'll augment what we are now, or
do you think it will replace us 

ELON MUSK:
Well, that's the scenario. The merge scenario with AI is the one that seems like probably the best. Like if-

JOE ROGAN:
For us 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Like if you can't beat it, join it. That's-

JOE ROGAN:
Yes, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
You know. So, from a long-term existential standpoint, that's like the purpose of Neuralink is to create a high bandwidth interface to
the brain such that we can be symbiotic with AI because we have a bandwidth problem. You just can't communicate through fingers.
It's too slow.

JOE ROGAN:
And where's Neuralink at right now 

ELON MUSK:
I think. we'll have something interesting to announce in a few months. That's, at least, an order of magnitude better than anything
else. I think better than, probably, anyone thinks is possible.

JOE ROGAN:
How much can you talk about that right now 

ELON MUSK:
I don't want to jump the gun on that.

JOE ROGAN:
But what's like the ultimate  What's the idea behind that  Like, what are you trying to accomplish with it  What would you like best
case scenario 

JOE ROGAN:
I think, best case scenario, we effectively merge with AI where AI serves as a tertiary cognition layer, where we've got the limbic
system. Kind of the, you know, primitive brain essentially. You got the cortex. So, you're currently in a symbiotic relationship. Your
cortex and limbic system are in a symbiotic relationship. And, generally, people like their cortex, and they like their limbic system. I
haven't met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or delete their cortex. Everybody seems to like both.

ELON MUSK:
And the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system. People may think that the thinking part of themselves is in charge, but it's
mostly their limbic system that's in charge. And the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy. That's what most of that
computing power is. It's launched towards, "How can I make the limbic system happy " That's what it's trying to do.

ELON MUSK:
Now, if we do have a third layer, which is the AI extension of yourself, that is also symbiotic. And there's enough bandwidth between
the cortex and the AI extension of yourself, such that the AI doesn't de facto separate. Then, that could be a good outcome. That
could be quite a positive outcome for the future.

JOE ROGAN:
So, instead of replacing us, it will radically change our capabilities 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. It will enable anyone who wants to have super human cognition, anyone who wants. This is not a matter of earning power
because your earning power would be vastly greater after you do it. So, it's just like anyone who wants can just do it in theory. That's
the theory. And if that's the case then, and let's say billions of people do it, then the outcome for humanity will be the sum of human
will, the sum of billions of people's desire for the future.

JOE ROGAN:
That billions of people with enhanced cognitive ability 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Radically enhanced 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And which would be   It   Buthow much different than people today  Like if you had to explain it to a person who didn't really
understand what you're saying, like how much different are you talking about  When you say radically improved, like, what do you
mean  You mean mind reading 

ELON MUSK:
It will be difficult to really appreciate the difference. It's kind of likehow much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without 
You're vastly smarter actually. You know, you can answer any question. If you connect to the internet, you can answer any question
pretty much instantly, any calculation, that your phone's memory is essentially perfect. You can remember flawlessly. Your phone
can remember videos, pictures, everything perfectly. That's the-

ELON MUSK:
Your phone is already an extension of you. You're already a cyborg. You don't even   What most people don't realize, they are
already a cyborg. That phone is an extension of yourself. It's just that the data rate, the rate at which   The communication rate
between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself, that is your phone and computer, is slow. It's very slow.

ELON MUSK:
And that is like a tiny straw of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. And we need to make that tiny straw
like a giant river. A huge high band with the interface. It's an interface problem, data rate problem. It's all the data rate problem that I
think we can hang on to human machine symbiosis through the long term. And then, people may decide that they want to retain their
biological self or not. I think they'll probably choose to retain the biological self.

JOE ROGAN:
Versus some sort of Ray Kurzweil scenario where they download themselves into a computer 

ELON MUSK:
You will be essentially snapshotted into a computer at any time. If your biological self dies, you could probably just upload it to a new
unit literally.

JOE ROGAN:
Pass that whiskey. We're getting crazy over here. Thisis getting ridiculous.

ELON MUSK:
Down the rabbit hole.

JOE ROGAN:
Grab that sucker. Give me some of that. Thisis too freaky. See, if I was just talking-

ELON MUSK:
I've been thinking about this for a long time, by the way.

JOE ROGAN:
I believe you. If I was talking to one   Cheers, by the way.

ELON MUSK:
Cheers. It is a great whiskey.

JOE ROGAN:
Thank you. I don't know where this came. Who brought this to us 
 
JOE ROGAN:
Somebody gave it to us. Old Camp. Whoever it was-

ELON MUSK:
It's good.

JOE ROGAN:
 thanks.

ELON MUSK:
It's good.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it is good. This is just inevitable. Again, going back to when you decided to have this fatalistic viewpoint. So, you weren't   You
tried to warn people. You talked about this pretty extensively. I've read several interviews where you talked about this. And then, you
just sort of just said, "Okay, it just is. Let's just-" And, in a way, by communicating the potential for   I mean, for sure, you're getting
the warning out to some people.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I was really going on the warning quite a lot. I was warning everyone I could. Yeah, I've met with Obama and
just for one reason, like, "Better watch out."

JOE ROGAN:
Just talk about AI.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And what did he say  So, what about Hillary  Worry about her first. Shh, everybody, quiet.

ELON MUSK:
He listened. He certainly listened. I met with Congress. I met with   Iwas at a meeting of all 50 governors and talked about just the
AI danger. And I talked to everyone I could. No one seemed to realize where this was going.

JOE ROGAN:
Is it that, or do they just assume that someone smarter than them is already taking care of it  Because when people hear about
something like AI, it's almost abstract. It's almost like it's so hard to wrap your head around it.

ELON MUSK:
It is.

JOE ROGAN:
By the time it happens, it will be too late 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I think, they didn't quite understand it, or didn't think it was near term, or not sure what to do about it. And I said, like, you know,
an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee, government committee, to gain insight. You know, before you oversight,
before you do make regulations, you should like try to understand what's going on. And then, you have an insight committee. Then,
once they learn what's going on, you get up to speed. Then, they can make maybe some rules or proposed some rules. And that
would be probably a safer way to go about things.

JOE ROGAN:
It seems   Imean, I know that it's probably something that the government's supposed to handle, but it seems like I wouldn't want
the   I don't want the government to handle this.

ELON MUSK:
Who do you want to handle this 

JOE ROGAN:
I want you to handle this.

ELON MUSK:
Oh geez.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. I feel like you're the one who could bring the bell better because if Mike Pence starts talking about AI, I'm like, "Shut up, bitch.
You don't know anything about AI. Come on, man. He doesn't know what he's talking about." That's just games.

ELON MUSK:
I don't have the power to regulate other companies. I don't if I'm supposed to, but you know.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, but maybe companies could agree. Maybe there could be some sort of a   What I mean is wehave agreements where you're
not supposed to dump toxic waste into the ocean, you're not supposed to do certain things that could be terribly damaging, even
though they would be profitable. Maybe this is one of those things.

JOE ROGAN:
Maybe we should realize that you can't hit the switch on something that's going to be able to think for itself and make up its own mind
as to whether or not it wants to survive or not, and whether or not it thinks you're a threat, or whether or not it thinks you're useless.
Like, "Why do I keep this dumb finite life form alive  Why  Why keep this thing around  It's just stupid. It just keeps polluting
everything. It's shitting everywhere it goes, lighting everything on fire, and shooting at each other. Why would I keep this stupid thing
alive  Because, sometimes, it makes good music, you know. Sometimes it makes great movies. Sometimes it makes beautiful art,
and sometimes   you know. Sometimes it's cool to hang out with. Like with my-

ELON MUSK:
Yes, for all those reasons.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. For us, those are great reasons.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
But for anything objective standing outside that go, "This is definitely a flawed system." This is like if you went to the jungle and you
watch these chimps engage in warfare and beat each other with wooden sticks.

ELON MUSK:
Chimps are really mean.

JOE ROGAN:
They're fucking real mean.

ELON MUSK:
They're fucking mean.

JOE ROGAN:
They're real mean.

ELON MUSK:
I saw a movie, Chimpanzee. I thought it was going to be like some Disney thing. Like, holy cow.

JOE ROGAN:
What movie was that 

ELON MUSK:
It's called Chimpanzee.

JOE ROGAN:
Is it a documentary 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. It's kind of like a documentary. I was like, "Damn,these chimps are mean."

JOE ROGAN:
They're mean.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
They're cruel.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. They're calculated. Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
They sneak up on each other and-

ELON MUSK:
Like, I didn't realize chimps did calculated cruelty.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
I was pretty   I leftthat meeting kinda like, "This is dark."

JOE ROGAN:
Right. Well, we know better because we've advanced. But if we hadn't, we'd be like, "Man, I don't want to fucking live in a house. I like
the chimp ways, bro. Chimp ways to go. This is it, man, chimp life. You know, we got-

ELON MUSK:
Simple chimp life.

JOE ROGAN:
Chimp life right now. But we, in a way, to the AI, might be like those chimps and like, "These stupid fucks launching missiles out of
drones, and shooting each other underwater." Like we're crazy. We got torpedoes, and submarines, and fucking airplanes that drop
nuclear bombs indiscriminately on cities. We're assholes.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
They might go, "Why are they doing this " It might, like, look at our politics, look at what we do in terms of our food system, what kind
of food we force down each other's throats. And they might go, "These people are crazy. They don't even look after themselves."

ELON MUSK:
I don't know. I mean, howmuch do we think about chimps  Not much.

JOE ROGAN:
Very little.

ELON MUSK:
It's like-

JOE ROGAN:
It's true.

ELON MUSK:
 these chimps are at war. This like look   It's likegroups of chimps just attack each other, and they kill each other. They torture
each other. That's pretty bad. They hunt monkeys. They're   Like this is probably the most, but, you know. I mean, when was the
last time you watched chimps 

JOE ROGAN:
Me 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
All the time.

ELON MUSK:
You do.

JOE ROGAN:
You're talking to the wrong guy.

ELON MUSK:
Okay. Well, unfortunately, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
This fucking podcast, dude, we're talking about chimps every episode.

ELON MUSK:
It's chimp city  Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
People are laughing right now. Yeah, constantly. I'm obsessed.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
I saw that David Attenborough documentary on chimps where they were eating those colobus monkeys and ripping them apart.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, this was rough.

JOE ROGAN:
I saw that many, many years ago.

ELON MUSK:
It's gruesome.

JOE ROGAN:
It just changed how-

ELON MUSK:
Gruesome.

JOE ROGAN:
I go, "Oh, this is why people are so crazy. We came from that thing."

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
It is the colobus.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
They got, like, better philosophy.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, they're like swingers.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, they really are. They seem to be way more   Even than us, way more civilized.

ELON MUSK:
They just seem to resolve everything with sex.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. The only rules they have is the mom won't bang the son. That's it.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
That's it. Mom won't bang her sons.They're good women.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Good women in the bonobo community.Everybody else is banging it out.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I haven't seen the Bonobo Movie.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, they're disturbing just at a zoo of bonobos at the zoo.

ELON MUSK:
They're just constantly going.

JOE ROGAN:
Constantly fucking, yeah. It's all they do.

ELON MUSK:
It's just one stuff.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. And they don't care, gay, straight, whatever. Let's just fuck. What's with these labels 

ELON MUSK:
I haven't seen bonobos at a zoo. I just probably like-

JOE ROGAN:
I don't think I have either.

ELON MUSK:
And not on the PJ section.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I don't think they have them at many zoos. We've looked at it before too, didn't we 

ELON MUSK:
It's probably pretty awkward.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. I think that's the thing. They don't like to keep regular chimps at zoos because bonobos are just always jacking off and-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Fucking it.
 
JOE ROGAN:
What's that  They have in San Diego 
 
JOE ROGAN:
Really  Interesting.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Probably separate them. Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, how many are there in a cage, you know  I was like-

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
 "It's going to be pretty intense."

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we're a weird thing, you know. And I've often wondered whether or not we're   you know, our ultimate goal is to
give birth to some new thing. And that's why we're so obsessed with technology because it's not like this technology is really   I
mean, it's certainly enhancing our lives too in a certain way, but, I mean, ultimately, is it making people happier right now  Most
technology I would say no. In fact, you and I were talking about social media before this about just not having Instagram on your
phone, and not dealing, and you feel better.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I think, one of the issues with social media, it's been pointed out by many people, is that, I think, maybe particularly Instagram
people look like they have a much better life than they really do.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
So-

JOE ROGAN:
By design.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. People are posting pictures of when they're really happy. They're modifying those pictures to be better looking. Even if they're
not modifying the pictures, they're, at least, selecting the pictures for the best lighting, the best angle. So, people basically seem they
are way better looking than they basically really are.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
And they're way happier seeming than they really are. So, if you look at everyone on Instagram, you might think, "Man, there are all
these happy beautiful people, and I'm not that good looking, and I am not happy. So, I must suck," you know. And that's going to
make you feel sad; when, in fact, those people you think are super happy, actually, not that happy. Some of them are really
depressed. They're very sad. Some of the happiest-seeming people are actually some of the saddest people in reality. And nobody
looks good all the time. It doesn't matter who you are.

JOE ROGAN:
No. It's not even something you should want.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Why do you want to look great all the time 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, exactly. So, I think things like that can make people quite sad just by comparison because you're sort of   People generally
think of themselves relative to others. It's like we are constantly re-baselining our expectations. And you can see to say if you watch
some show like Naked and Afraid, or, you know, if you just go and try living in the woods by yourself for a while, and you're like, "The
land that civilization is quite great." People want to come back to civilization pretty fast on Naked or Afraid.

JOE ROGAN:
Wasn't there a Theodore quote, that "Comparison is the thief of joy."

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Happiness is reality minus expectations.

JOE ROGAN:
That's great too, but the comparison is the thief of joy really holds true to people. Is it 
 
JOE ROGAN:
Roosevelt, fascinating. And when you're thinking about Instagram, because what essentially Instagram is for a lot of people is you're
giving them the opportunity to be their own PR agent, and they always go towards the glamorous, you know. And when anybody
does show, you know, #nofilter, they really do do that. "Oh, you're so brave. Look at you, no makeup," you know, which theylook
good anyway.

JOE ROGAN:
"You look great. What are you doing  Oh my God. You don't have makeup on. You still look hotas fuck. You know what you're
doing. I know what you're doing too." They're letting you know. And then, they're feeding off that comment section. Sort of sitting
there like it's a fresh stream of love. Like you're getting right up to the sources as it comes out of the earth, and you're sucking that
sweet, sweet love water.

ELON MUSK:
A lot of emojies, smoggy emojies.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
A lot of emojies.

JOE ROGAN:
My concern is not so much what Instagram is. It's that I didn't think that people had the need for this or the expectation for some sort
of technology that allows them to constantly get love and adulation from strangers, and comments, and this ability to project this sort
of distorted version of who you really are.

JOE ROGAN:
But I worry about where it goes. Like what's the next one  What's the next one  Like, where's is it  Is it going to be augmented to
some sort of a weird augmented or virtual sort of Instagram type situation where you're not going to want to live in this real world,
you're going to want to interface with this sort of world that you've created through your social media page and some next level thing.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Go live in the simulation.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, man.

ELON MUSK:
In the simulation.

JOE ROGAN:
Some ready player one type shit that's real. That seems   we have that HTC vibe here. I've only done it a couple times quite
honestly because it kind of freaks me out.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
My kids fucking love it, man. They love it. They love playing these weirdo games and walking around that headset on. But part of me
watching them do it goes, "Wow, I wonder if this is like the precursor." Just sort of like if you look at that phone that Gordon Gekko
had on the beach and you compare that-

ELON MUSK:
Yes, the big cell phone.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, you pair that to like a Galaxy Note 9.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Like how the fuckdid that become that, right  And I wonder when I see this HTC Vibe, I'm like, "Whatis that thing going to be 10
years from now when we're making fun of what it is now " I mean, howingrained, and how connected and interconnected is this
technology going to be in our life 

ELON MUSK:
It will be, at some point, indistinguishable from reality.

JOE ROGAN:
We will lose this. We'll lose this. Like you and I are just looking at each other throughour eyes.

ELON MUSK:
Are we 

JOE ROGAN:
I see you. You see me, I think, I hope.

ELON MUSK:
You think so 

JOE ROGAN:
I think you probably have regular eyes.

ELON MUSK:
This could be some simulation.

JOE ROGAN:
It could. Do you entertain that 

ELON MUSK:
Well, the argument for the simulation, I think, is quite strong because if you assume any improvements at all over time, any
improvement, 1%, 0.1%, just extend the time frame, make it a thousand years, a million years. The universe is 13.8 billion years old.
Civilization, if you count it, if you're very generous, civilization is maybe 7000 or 8000 years old if you count it from the first writing.
This is nothing. This is nothing.

ELON MUSK:
So, if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will end. One of
those two things will occur. Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation.

JOE ROGAN:
Or we're on our way to one, right 

ELON MUSK:
Because we exist.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, not just because we exist.

ELON MUSK:
Pretty exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
We could most certainly be on the road. We could be on the road to that, right. it doesn't mean that it has to have already happened.

ELON MUSK:
It could be in base reality. It could be in base reality.

JOE ROGAN:
We could be here now on our way to the road or on our way to the destination where this can never happen again, where we are
completely ingrained in some sort of an artificial technology or some sort of a symbiotic relationship with the internet or the next level
of sharing information. But, right now, we're not there yet. That's possible too, right  It's possible that a simulation is, one day, going
to be inevitable, that we're going to have something that's indistinguishable from regular reality, but maybe we're not there yet. That's
also possible.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes, it is.

ELON MUSK:
Though we're not quite there yet. This is real. You want to touchthat wood 

ELON MUSK:
It feel very real.

JOE ROGAN:
Maybe that's why everybody is like into like mason jars and shit.

ELON MUSK:
Mason jars.

JOE ROGAN:
Suede shoes. People that like craft restaurants, and they want raw wood. Everyone wants the metal people. It seems like people are
like longing toward some weird log cabin type nostalgia.

ELON MUSK:
Sure, reality.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, like holding on. Like clinging.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Dragging their nails through the man like, "Don'ttake me yet."

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
"I want to-"

ELON MUSK:
But then, people go get a mason jar with a wine stem or a handle. That's dark.

JOE ROGAN:
It makes me-

ELON MUSK:
It makes me lose faith in humanity.

JOE ROGAN:
Mason jar, wine stem and a handle, they have those 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
The sturdy people. That's just assholes. That's like people make pet rocks.

ELON MUSK:
Rough.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. Some people are just assholes. They take advantage of our generous nature.

ELON MUSK:
It was made with the wine stem. Made with handle.

JOE ROGAN:
They made it that way 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. They're manufactured like that.

JOE ROGAN:
So, the one way, they welded it on to the mason jar. You fuck.

ELON MUSK:
But that would be fine if there was like glued it on or something.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. There would be like-

ELON MUSK:
But it was made that way.

JOE ROGAN:
Like trash shit. Oh, this is disgusting. Look at this. It is right there.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, it's pretty harsh. Yup.

JOE ROGAN:
This is terrible. Yeah. That's like fake breasts that are designed to be hard. Like fake breasts from the '60s. It's like if you really long
for the ones with ripples, here we go. Yeah. That's almost what that is.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
What are you going to do, man  There's nothing, you know. There's nothing you can do tostop certain terrible ideas from
propagating.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Anyway, I don't want to sound like things are too dark because I think like you kind of have to be optimistic about the future.
There's no point in being pessimistic. It's just too negative because it is-

JOE ROGAN:
It doesn't help.

ELON MUSK:
It doesn't help, you know. I think you want to be   I mean, my theory is like you'd rather be optimistic. I think, I'd rather be optimistic
and wrong than pessimistic and right.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
At least, we're on that side.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Because if you're pessimistic, it's going to be miserable.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Yeah, nobody wants to be around you anyway if it's the end of the world. You're like, "I fucking told you, bro."

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
The world is ending. Yeah. It is way   it is for all.

ELON MUSK:
I did my part.

JOE ROGAN:
I mean-

ELON MUSK:
Enjoy the journey.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. If you really want to get morose, I mean, it is what it is for all of us anyway. We're all going to go, unless something changes.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
I mean, ultimately, you know, even if we just sort of existed as humans forever, we'd still eventually would be like the heat death of
the universe-

ELON MUSK:
Gazillion years from now.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, even if we get it past the sun.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
If we figure out a way past the sun running out of juice.

ELON MUSK:
Eventually, it's going to end. It's just a question of when.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
So, it really is all about the journey.

JOE ROGAN:
Or transcendence from whatever we are now into something that doesn't worry about death.

ELON MUSK:
The universe, as we know it, will dissipate into a fine mist of cold nothingness eventually.

JOE ROGAN:
And then, someone's going to bottle it and put a fragrance to it, sell it to French people in another dimension.

ELON MUSK:
It's just a very long time.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
So, I think it's really just about, how can we make it last longer 

JOE ROGAN:
Are you a proponent of the multi-universe's theory  Do you believe that there are many, many universes, and that even if this one
fades out that there's other ones that are starting fresh right now, and there's an infinite number of them, and they're just constantly in
a never-ending cycle of birth and death 

ELON MUSK:
I think most likely. This is just about probability. There are many, many simulations. These simulations, we might as well call them
reality, or we could call them the multiverse.

JOE ROGAN:
These simulations you believe are created like someone has manufactured-

ELON MUSK:
They're running on the substrate.

JOE ROGAN:
So-

ELON MUSK:
That substrate is probably boring.

JOE ROGAN:
Boring 

ELON MUSK:
Mmhmm.

JOE ROGAN:
How so 

ELON MUSK:
Well, when we create a simulation like a game or a movie, it's the distillation of what's interesting about life. You know, it takes a year
to shoot an action movie. And then, that's all to slow down into two or three hours. So, let me tell you, if you've seen an action movie
being filmed, it's freaking   It's boring. It'ssuper boring. It takes   There's like lots of takes. Everything's in a green screen. It looks
pretty goofy. It doesn't look cool. But once you had the CGI, and have great editing, it's amazing.

ELON MUSK:
So, I think, most likely, if we're a simulation, it's really boring outside the simulation because why would you make simulation as
boring  You'd make simulation way more interesting than base reality.

JOE ROGAN:
That is if this right now is a simulation.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And, ultimately, inevitably, as long as we don't die or get hit by a meteor, we're going to create some sort of simulation if we continue
on the same technological path we're on right now.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
But we might not be there yet. So, it might not be a simulation here. But it most likely is you feel other places.

ELON MUSK:
This notion of a place or where is-

JOE ROGAN:
Flawed 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Flawed perception.

ELON MUSK:
Like that if you have that, sort of, that vibe you have, which is for the   that's wasmade by valve, and it's really valve that made it.
HTC did the hardware, but it's really a valve thing.

JOE ROGAN:
Makers of Half-life.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Great company.

JOE ROGAN:
Great company.

ELON MUSK:
When you're in that virtual reality, which is only going to get better, where are you  Where are you really 

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
You aren't anywhere.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, whereas-

ELON MUSK:
You're in the computer.

JOE ROGAN:
You know, what defines where you are 

ELON MUSK:
Exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
It's your perception.

JOE ROGAN:
Is it your perceptions or is it, you know, a scale that we have under your butt. You're right here. I've measured you. You're the same
weight as you were when you left. But meanwhile, your experience is probably different-

ELON MUSK:
Why do you think you're where you are right now  You might not be.

JOE ROGAN:
I'll buck up a joint if you keep talking. Your man is just going to come in here. We might have to lock the door.

ELON MUSK:
Right now, you think you're in a studio in LA.

JOE ROGAN:
That's what I heard.

ELON MUSK:
You might be in a computer.

JOE ROGAN:
Man, I think about this all the time. Yeah, I mean, it's unquestionable that one day that will be the case, as long as we keep going, as
long as nothing interrupts us, and if we start from scratch, and, you know, we're single-celled organisms all over again. And then,
millions and millions of years later, we become the next thing that is us with creativity and the ability to change this environment. It's
going to keep monkeying with things until it figures out a way to change reality. To change   Imean, almost like punch a hole through
what is this thing into what what it wants it to be and create new things. And then, those new things will intersect with other people's
new things, and there will be this ultimate pathway of infinite ideas and expression all through technology.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And then, we're going to wonder like, "Why are wehere  What are we doing "

ELON MUSK:
Let's find out.

JOE ROGAN:
Well-

ELON MUSK:
I mean, I think we should take the actions, the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes, right.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. Right. And then, we evaluate those actions to make sure that it's true.

ELON MUSK:
Well, I think there's a movement to that. I mean, in terms of like a social movement. I think some of it's misguided, and some of it's
exaggerated, and there's a lot of people that are fighting for their side out there. But it seems like the general trend of, like, social
awareness seems to be much more heightened now than has ever been in any other time in history because of our ability to express
ourselves instantaneously to each other through Facebook, or Twitter, or what have you. And that the trend is to abandon
preconceived notions, abandon prejudice, abandon discrimination, and promote kindness and happiness as much as possible.
Looking at this knife  Somebody gave it to me. Sorry.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. What is it 

JOE ROGAN:
Fuck you. My friend, Donnie, brought this with him, and it just stayed here. I have a real samurai sword, if you want to play with that. I
know you're into weapons. That's from the 1500s. Samurai's something on the table.

ELON MUSK:
Good.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
That's cool.

JOE ROGAN:
I'll grab it. Hold on. Yeah, that's legit samurai sword from an actual samurai from the 1500s. If you pull out that blade, that blade was
made the old way where a master craftsman-

ELON MUSK:
Folded metal 

JOE ROGAN:
Folded that metal and hammered it down over and over again over a long period of time, and honed that blade into what it is now.
What's crazy is that more than 500 years later, that thing is still pristine. I mean, whoever took care of that and passed it down to the
next person who took care of it, and you know until it got to the podcast room, it's pretty fucking crazy.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
One day, someone's going to be looking at a Tesla like that. How many of thesefucking backdoor they pop off sideways like a
Lamborghini 

ELON MUSK:
They should see what the Tesla can do. He didn't   Youshould   I'll show you how to once.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, I've driven one. I love them.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, but most people don't know what it can do.

JOE ROGAN:
In terms like ludicrous mode  In terms of like driving super fast and irresponsibly on public roads, is that what you're saying 

ELON MUSK:
Any car can do that.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. What can it do that I need to know about 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, the Model X can do this like ballet thing to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. It's pretty cool.

JOE ROGAN:
Wait, it dances 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Legitimate, like it goes around 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Why would you program that into a car 

ELON MUSK:
It seemed like fun.

JOE ROGAN:
That's what I get about you. That's what's weird. Like when you showed up here, you were all smiles, and you pull out a fucking
blowtorch and not a blowtorch, but I'm like, "Look at this-"

ELON MUSK:
Not a flamethrower.

JOE ROGAN:
Not a flamethrower. Like, "He's having fun."

ELON MUSK:
I want to be clear, it's definitelynot a flamethrower.

JOE ROGAN:
But you're having fun. Like this thing, you know, you program a car to do a ballet dance, you're having fun.

ELON MUSK:
It's great.

JOE ROGAN:
But how do you have the time to do that  I don't understand why you're digging holes under the earth, and sending rockets into
space, and powering people in Australia. Like how the fuck do you have time to make the car dance ballet 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean, in that case there were some engineers at Tesla that said, "You know, what if we make this car dance and play music "
I'm like, "That sounds great. Please do it. Let's try to get it done in time for Christmas." We did.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there a concern about someone just losing their mind and making it do that on the highway 

ELON MUSK:
No, it won't do that.

JOE ROGAN:
What if it's in bumper-to-bumper traffic 

ELON MUSK:
Nope.

JOE ROGAN:
No, it won't do it 

ELON MUSK:
No. Actually, you have to sneeze drag.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, sneeze drag.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, that's why people don't know about it. But if you have the car-

JOE ROGAN:
Well-

ELON MUSK:
It's like it could do lots of things, lots of things.

JOE ROGAN:
Once Reddit gets a hold of it, everyone's going to know already.

ELON MUSK:
You just have to   Everyone, ifyou search for it on the internet, you will find out.

JOE ROGAN:
They will find.

ELON MUSK:
But people don't know that they should even search for it.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, they do now.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
There's so many things about the Model X, and the Model S, and the Model 3 that people don't know about. We should probablydo
a video or something to explain it because I have close friends of mine and I say, "Do you know the car can do this " and they're like,
"Nope."

JOE ROGAN:
Do you want to do a video of that  Do you like the fact that some people don't know 

ELON MUSK:
No, I think it's probably not. We should tell people.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, probably.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
That would help your product. I mean, it's not like you don't sell enough of them. You sell almost too many of them, right.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, I think, a Tesla is the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever. That's what it's meant to be. Well, our goal is to make   It's
not exactly a car. It's actually a thing to maximize enjoyment, make as maximum fun.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay. Electronic, like big screen, laptop, ridiculous speed, handling, all that stuff.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you have a-

ELON MUSK:
And we're going to put video games in it.

JOE ROGAN:
You are 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Is that wise 

ELON MUSK:
Well-

JOE ROGAN:
What kind of video games  Candy Crush 

ELON MUSK:
You won't be able to drive while you're playing the video game. But, like, for example, we're just putting the Atari emulator, RAM
emulator in it. So, we'll play a Missile Command, and Lunar Lander, and a bunch of other things. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
That sounds cool.

ELON MUSK:
It's pretty fun.

JOE ROGAN:
I like that.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, probe the interface for Missile Command because it's too hard with the old trackball. So, there's a touch screen
version of Missile Command. So, you have a chance.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you   You have an old car, don't you  Don't you have like an old Jaguar 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. How did you know that  Let's pause for that. I have a'61 series 1 E-type Jaguar.

JOE ROGAN:
I love cars.

ELON MUSK:
It's great.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I love old cars.

ELON MUSK:
The only-

JOE ROGAN:
That's one of the things-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, the only two gassing cars I have are that and an old   like aFord Model T that a friend of mine gave me. Those are my only
two gasoline cars.

JOE ROGAN:
Is the Ford Model T all stock  Oh, there's your car. Look at that.

ELON MUSK:
I have the convertible.

JOE ROGAN:
That is a gorgeous car.

ELON MUSK:
It's a soft car.

JOE ROGAN:
God, that's a good looking car.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Is that yours 

ELON MUSK:
That is   It's not mine. It's extremely close to mine, but I don't have a front license plate on mine.

JOE ROGAN:
It's a beautiful car. They nailed it. That new type-

ELON MUSK:
Mine looks like that.

JOE ROGAN:
God, they nailed that.

ELON MUSK:
That's what mine looks like. Maybe it is mine.

JOE ROGAN:
There's certain iconic shapes.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And there's something about those cars too. They're not as capable, not nearly as capable as like a Tesla, but there's something
really satisfying about the mechanical aspect of like feeling the steering, and the-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
 grinding of the gears and the shifting. Something about those that's extremely satisfying even though they're not that competent.
Like I have a 1993 Porsche 964. It's like lightweight. It's an RS America. It's not very fast. It's not like in comparison to a Tesla or
anything like that. But the thing about it is like it's mechanical, you feel it. Everything's like-

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
It's like it gives you this weird thrill, like you're on this clunky ride, and there's all this feedback. There's something to that.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah. My E Type is like basically no electronics.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
It's-

JOE ROGAN:
And so, you like that, but you also like electronics.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Like Tesla Sup, it's like the far end of electronics.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
It drives itself.

ELON MUSK:
It's driving itself better every day.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
We're about to release the software that will enable you to just turn it on, and it'll drive from highway on ramp, to highway exit, do lane
changes, overtake other cars-

JOE ROGAN:
Jesus.

ELON MUSK:
To go from one interchange to the next. If you get on, say, the 405, get off 300 miles later, and go through several highway
interchanges, and just overtake other cars, and hook into the nav system, and then-.

JOE ROGAN:
And you're just meditating, om.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
While your car is just traveling.

ELON MUSK:
It's kind of eerie. It's kind of eerie.

JOE ROGAN:
What did you think when you saw that video of that dude fallen asleep behind the wheel  I'm sure you've seen it, the one in San
Francisco. It's like right outside of San Jose. It's out cold, like this. And the cars an inch bumper-to-bumper in traffic moving along.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
You've seen it, right 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. We just changed the software. Changedthe software. That's, I think, an old video. We changed software. Ifyou don't
touch the wheel, it will gradually slow down, and put the emergency lights on, and wake you up.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, that's hilarious.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
That's hilarious.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Can you choose what voice wakes you up 

ELON MUSK:
Well, it's sort of more of a   It sort of honks.

JOE ROGAN:
It honks.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
There should be like, "Wake up, fuckface. You're endangering your fellow humans."

ELON MUSK:
We could gently wake you up with a sultry voice.

JOE ROGAN:
That would be good like something with a southern accent. "Hey, wake up."

ELON MUSK:
Wake up, sunshine.

JOE ROGAN:
Hey, sweetie.

ELON MUSK:
Exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
Why don't you wake up 

ELON MUSK:
You could pick your-

JOE ROGAN:
Right, like-

ELON MUSK:
Like whatever you want. Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I choose the Australian girl for Siri.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
I like her voice.

ELON MUSK:
Do you want it seductive 

JOE ROGAN:
It's my favorite. I like Australian.

ELON MUSK:
What flavor  Do what you want it to be angry. It could be anything.

JOE ROGAN:
You want those Australian prison lady genes. Now, when you program something like that in, is this in response to a concern, or is it
your own 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Do look at it and go, "Hey, they shouldn't just be able to fallasleep. Let's wake them up."

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. It's like   Youknow, we're like   Yeah, people are falling asleep. We've got to do something about that.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. But when you first released it, you didn't consider it, right  You're just like, "Well, no one's going to just sleep."

ELON MUSK:
People fall asleep in their cars all the time.

JOE ROGAN:
All the time.

ELON MUSK:
They crash.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it's horrible.

ELON MUSK:
At least, our car doesn't crash.That's better.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
It's better not to crash.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Imagine if that guy had fallen asleep in a gasoline car, they do all the time.

JOE ROGAN:
For sure, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
They would crash into somebody.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
And, in fact, the thing that really, you know, got me to   It's like,"Man, we better get a autopilot going and get it out." A guy was in an
early Tesla driving down the highway, and he fell asleep, and he ran over a cyclist, and killed him. I was like, "Man, ifwe had
autopilot, he might have fallen asleep, but, at least, he wouldn't run over that cyclist."

JOE ROGAN:
So, how did you implement it  Like did you just use cameras and-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
 programmed with the system, so that if it sees images, it slows down  And how much time do you get  And like-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Is the person who's in control of it allow the program to how fast it goes 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Yeah, you can program it to be more or less, like more conservative or like more aggressive driver. And you can say what
speed you want it to   What speed is okay.

JOE ROGAN:
I know you have ludicrous mode. Do you have douchebag mode 

ELON MUSK:
Well, in-

JOE ROGAN:
It just cuts people off.

ELON MUSK:
Well, for lane changes, it's tricky because if you're in like LA, like unless you're pretty aggressive, right, it's hard to change lanes
sometimes.

JOE ROGAN:
You can't. It's hard to be Satnam. It's hard to be Namaste here in LA.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
If you want to hit that Santa Monica Boulevard off in-

ELON MUSK:
I mean, you've got to be a little pushy.

JOE ROGAN:
You've got to be a little pushy, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
On the freeway.

JOE ROGAN:
Especially if you were angry.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
If you're a little angry, they don'twant you, and they speed up.

ELON MUSK:
Sometimes, yeah, I think, people like overall are pretty nice on the highway, even in LA, but sometimes they're not.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think the Neuralink will help that quick 

ELON MUSK:
Probably.

JOE ROGAN:
Everybody will be locked in together, this hive mind.

ELON MUSK:
Tunnels will help it. We wouldn't have traffic.

JOE ROGAN:
That will help a lot.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
How many of those can you put in there 

ELON MUSK:
Nice thing about tunnels-

JOE ROGAN:
Are you thinking about for everybody 

ELON MUSK:
Nice thing about tunnels is you can go 3D.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh right.

ELON MUSK:
So, you can go many levels.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
So-

JOE ROGAN:
Until you hit.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, but you go   You can have 100 levels of with bombs.

JOE ROGAN:
Jesus Christ. I don't want to be on99. That would be a negative 99 floors.

ELON MUSK:
This is one of the fundamental things people don't appreciate about tunnels is that it's not like roads. The fundamental issue with
roads is that you have a 2D transport system and a 3D living and workspace environment. So, you've got all these tallbuildings or
concentrated work environments. And then, you want to go into those like 2D transport system with-

JOE ROGAN:
Hugely inefficient.

ELON MUSK:
 pretty low density because cars are spaced out pretty far. And so, that, obviously, is not going to work. You're going to have traffic
guaranteed. But if you can go 3D on your transport system, then you can solve all traffic. And you can either go 3D up with a flying
car, or you can go 3D down with tunnels. You can have as many tunnel levels as you want, and you can arbitrarily relieve any
amount of traffic. You can go further down with tunnels than you can go up with buildings. You're 10,000 feet down if you want. I
wouldn't recommended it, but-.

JOE ROGAN:
What was that movie with   What's his face  Bradley   Not Bradley Cooper, Christian  No. What the fuck is his name  Batman.
Who is Batman 
 
JOE ROGAN:
Christian Bale, where they fought dragons. Him and Matthew McConaughey. He went down deep into the earth. How deep can you
go 

ELON MUSK:
I don't think that was Batman.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it was. Yeah, it was.

ELON MUSK:
Batman fought dragons  I don't-

JOE ROGAN:
No, it wasn't Batman but it's Christian Bale.
 
JOE ROGAN:
Rain of Fire.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
Never saw that 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Terrible. Terrible but good. I would look at it some time.

ELON MUSK:
I wouldn't recommend drilling super far down but the earth is a big-

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, but you can't drill deep. It gets hot, right 

ELON MUSK:
 molten

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
The earth is a giant ball of lava with a thin crust on the top, which we think of as like the surface, this thin crust. And it's mostly just a
big bowl of lava. That's earth, but 10,000 feet is not a big deal.

JOE ROGAN:
Have you given any consideration whatsoever to the flat earth movement 

ELON MUSK:
That's a troll situation.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, it's not. No, it's not. You would like to think that-

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
 because you're super genius. But I, as a normal person, I know these people are way dumber than me. And they really, really
believe. They watch YouTube videos, which go on uninterrupted, and spew out a bunch of fucking fake facts very eloquently and
articulately. And they really believe. These people really believe.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, if it works for them, sure. Fine.

JOE ROGAN:
It's weird though, right, that in this age where, you know, there's ludicrous mode in your car, goes 1.9 seconds, 060.

ELON MUSK:
That's 2.2.

JOE ROGAN:
2.2. Which one's 1.9  The Coaster.

ELON MUSK:
The Next Generation Roadster.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
Standard edition.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I'm on top of this shit.

ELON MUSK:
That's just without-

JOE ROGAN:
Standard edition.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. So, it's not the performance package.

JOE ROGAN:
What performance package 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
What the fuck do you need 

ELON MUSK:
We put a rocket thruster in it.

JOE ROGAN:
For real 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
What are they going to burn 

ELON MUSK:
Nothing. Ultrahigh pressure compressed air.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa. Just air 

ELON MUSK:
Just called gas thrusters.

JOE ROGAN:
Then, do you have the air tanks or the-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Sucking air, okay.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It has an electric pump.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa.

ELON MUSK:
Pump it up like 10,000 PSI.

JOE ROGAN:
And how fast are we talking  Zero to 60.

ELON MUSK:
How fast you want to go 

JOE ROGAN:
I want to go-

ELON MUSK:
We could make this thing fly.

JOE ROGAN:
I want to go back in time.

ELON MUSK:
I can make it fly.

JOE ROGAN:
You make it fly 

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you anticipate that as being   I mean, you'retalking about the tunnels and then flying cars. Do you really think that's going to be
real 

ELON MUSK:
Too noisy, and there's too much airflow. So, the final issue withflying cars, I mean, ifyou get like one of those like toy drones, think
of how loud those are and how much air they blow. Now, imagine if that's like a thousand times heavier. This is not going to make
your neighbors happy. Your neighbors are not going to be happy if you land a flying car in your backyard.

JOE ROGAN:
It will be very helicopter-like.

ELON MUSK:
Or on your roof. It's just really going to be like, "What the hell. That wasannoying."

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
You can't even   Like, if you want a flying car, just put some wheels on a helicopter.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there a way around that  Like what if they figure out some sort of magnetic technology, like all those Bob Lazar type characters
who were thinking that was a part of the UFO technology they were doing at Area 51  Remember, didn't they have some thoughts
about magnetics  Nope.

JOE ROGAN:
No  Bullshit 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Really 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. There's a fundamental momentum exchange with the air. So, you must accelerate. There's like this   There's a sudden   You
have a mass, and you have gravitational acceleration. And mass times   Your mass times gravity must equal the mass of airflow
times acceleration of that airflow to have a neutral force. MG=MA

JOE ROGAN:
So, it's impossible to go around-

ELON MUSK:
And then you won't move.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
If MG is greater than MA, you will go down. And if MA is greater than MG, you will go up. That's how it works.

JOE ROGAN:
There's just no way around that 

ELON MUSK:
There is definitely no way around it.

JOE ROGAN:
There's no way to create some sort of a magnetic something or another that allows you to float 

ELON MUSK:
Technically, yes. You could have a strong enough magnet, but that magnet would be so strong that you would create a lot of trouble.

JOE ROGAN:
It would just suck cars up into your car  Just pick up axles and do that 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, it should have to repel off of either material on the ground or in a really nutty situation off of Earth's gravitational field, and
somehow make that incredibly light, but that magnet would cause so much destruction. You'd be better off with a helicopter.

JOE ROGAN:
So, if there was some sort of magnet road, like you have two magnets, and they repel each other, if you had some sort of a magnet
road that was below you, and you could travel on that magnet road, that would work 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Yes, you can have a magnet road.

JOE ROGAN:
A magnet road. Is that too ridiculous 

ELON MUSK:
No, it will work. So, you could do that.

JOE ROGAN:
That's ridiculous too, right 

ELON MUSK:
I would not recommend it.

JOE ROGAN:
There's a lot of things you don't recommend.

ELON MUSK:
I would super not recommend that. Not good. Not wise, I think.

JOE ROGAN:
No 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Magnet roads 

ELON MUSK:
No. No. No, definitely not. Definitely not. Yeah, it would cause a lot of trouble.

JOE ROGAN:
So, you put some time and consideration into this other than   You know, instead like my foolishly rendered thoughts. So, you think
that tunnels are the way to do it 

ELON MUSK:
Oh, it will work, for sure.

JOE ROGAN:
That'll work 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And these tunnels that you're building right now, these are basically just like test versions of this ultimate idea that you have 

ELON MUSK:
You know, it's just a hole in the ground.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. We played videos of it where your ideas-

ELON MUSK:
It's just a hole in the ground.

JOE ROGAN:
 that you drop that hole in the ground. There's a sled on it, and the sled goes very fast, like 100 miles an hour plus.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it can go real fast. You can go as fast as youwant. And then, if you want to go long distances, you can just draw the air out of
the tunnel, make sure it's real straight.

JOE ROGAN:
Draw the air out of the tunnel 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it's sort of vacuum tunnel because the   And then, depending on how fast you want to go, you're going to take thesewheels,
or you could use air bearings depending upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel, or you could mag lev it if you want to go super fast.

JOE ROGAN:
So, magnet road 

ELON MUSK:
Yes, underground magnet roads.

JOE ROGAN:
Underground magnet roads 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Otherwise, you're going to really create a lot of trouble because of those metal things.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh. So, magnet road is the way to go, just underground.

ELON MUSK:
If you want to go really fast underground, you would be mag lev in a vacuum tunnel.

JOE ROGAN:
Mag in a vacuum tunnel.

ELON MUSK:
Magnetic levitation in a vacuum tunnel launchers. Fun 

JOE ROGAN:
With rocket launchers 

ELON MUSK:
No, I would not recommend putting any-

JOE ROGAN:
Come on.

ELON MUSK:
 exhaust gas in the tunnel.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, okay. I see what you're saying because then the air will be gone.

ELON MUSK:
Because, then, the air will pump it out.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. You have to pump it out, and you probably have limited amount of air in the first place. Like how much can you breathe  Do
you have to pump oxygen into these cubicles, these tubes 

ELON MUSK:
No. We have a pressurized pod. It'd be like a little tiny underground spaceship basically.

JOE ROGAN:
Like an airplane because you have air on airplanes. It's not getting new air in.

ELON MUSK:
It is.

JOE ROGAN:
It is 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
You have like a little hole 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, they have a pump.

JOE ROGAN:
Really 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
So, it gets it from the outside 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Wow, I didn't know that.

ELON MUSK:
It's like the air's  Airplanes have it easy because, essentially, you can   they're pretty leaky, but-

JOE ROGAN:
Jesus.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, but as long as the air pump is working at a distance. I mean, theyhave backup pumps, sort of like,you know, three pumps, or
four pumps, or something. And then, there's like   It exhausts through the outflow valve and through whatever seals are not sealing
quite right. Usually, the door doesn't seal quite right on the plane. So, there's a bit of leakage around the door. But the pumps exceed
the outflow rate. And then, that sets the pressure in the cabin.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, have you ever looked at planes and gone, "I can fix this."

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
"I just don't have the time."

ELON MUSK:
I have a design for a plane.

JOE ROGAN:
You do 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
A better design 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, probably. I think it is, yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Who have you talked to about this 

ELON MUSK:
I've talked to friends.

JOE ROGAN:
Friends 

ELON MUSK:
Friends and-

JOE ROGAN:
I'm your friend.

ELON MUSK:
Girlfriends and-

JOE ROGAN:
You can tell me. What you got  What's going on 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean, the exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical takeoff and landing, supersonic jet of some kind.

JOE ROGAN:
Vertical takeoff and landing meaning no need for a runway. Just shoot up straight in the air.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
How would you do that  I mean, theydo that in some military aircraft, correct 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. The trick is that you have to transition to level flight. And then, the thing that you would use for vertical takeoff and landing is not
suitable for high-speed flight.

JOE ROGAN:
So, you have two different systems  Vertical takeoff is one system 

ELON MUSK:
I've thought about this quite a lot. I've thought about this quite a lot.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
I guess, thinking about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the
battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. Once you've overcome gravitational potential energy, and
you're out at a high altitude, the energy use in cruise is very low. And then, you can recapture a large part of the gravitational
potential energy on the way down. So, you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of
height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy.

ELON MUSK:
So, once you can get high, like the way to think about a plane is it's a force balance. So, the force balance   So, a plane that is not
accelerating is a neutral force balance. You have the force of gravity, you have the lift force, you have the wings. Then, you've got
the force of the whatever thrusting device, so the propeller, or turbine, or whatever it is. And you've got the resistance force of the air.

ELON MUSK:
Now, the higher you go, the lower the air resistance is. Air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square, and
exponential beats the square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy. And at a certain altitude, you
can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it's just a force
balance.

JOE ROGAN:
I'm too stupid for this conversation.

ELON MUSK:
It makes sense though.

JOE ROGAN:
No, I'm sure it does. Now, when you think about this new idea of of design, when you have this idea about improving planes, are you
going to bring this to somebody and check this one out 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I have a lot on my plate.

JOE ROGAN:
Right. That's what I'm saying. I don't know how you do what you do now, but if you keep coming up with these. But it's got to be hard
to pawn this off on someone else either, like, "Hey, go do a good job with this vertical takeoff and landing system that I want to
implement to regular planes.".

ELON MUSK:
The airplane, electric airplane isn't necessarily right now. Electric cars are important. We need-

JOE ROGAN:
We need some sort of-

ELON MUSK:
Solar energy is important. Stationary storage of energy is important. These things are much more important than creating electric
supersonic futile. Also, the plane's naturally   You really want that gravitational energy density for an aircraft, and this improving over
time. So, you know, it's important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. That's why electric cars, it matters whether
electric cars happen sooner or later. You know, we're really playing a crazy game here with the atmosphere or the oceans.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
We're taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this in the atmosphere. It's just crazy. We should not do
this. It's very dangerous. So, we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I mean, the bizarre thing is that, obviously,
we're going to run out of oil in the long term. You know, we're going to   There's only so much oil we can mine and burn. It's totally
logical. We must have a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term.

ELON MUSK:
So, we know that's the endpoint. We know that. So, why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon from
underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans  This is an insane experiment. It's the dumbest experiment in human history.
Why are we doing this  It's crazy.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think this is a product of momentum that we started off doing this when it was just a few engines, a few hundred million
gallons of fuel over the whole world, not that big of a deal  And then, slowly but surely over a century, it got out of control. And now,
it's not just our fuel, but it's also, I mean, fossil fuels are involved in so many different electronics, so many different items that people
buy. It's just this constant desire for fossil fuels, constant need for oil-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Without consideration of the sustainability.

ELON MUSK:
You know, the things like oil, oil, coal, gas, it's easy money.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
It's easy money. So-

JOE ROGAN:
Have you heard about clean coal  The president's been tweeting about it. It's got to be real. CLEAN COAL, all caps. Did you see 
He used all caps. Clean coal.

ELON MUSK:
Well, you know, it's very difficult to put that CO2 back in the ground. It doesn't like being in solid form.

JOE ROGAN:
Have you thought about something like that 

ELON MUSK:
It takes a lot of energy.

JOE ROGAN:
Like some sort of a filter, giant building-sized filter sucks carbon out in the atmosphere  Is that possible 

ELON MUSK:
No, no, it doesn't. It's not possible.

JOE ROGAN:
No 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
No 

ELON MUSK:
Nope, definitely not.

JOE ROGAN:
So, we're fucked 

ELON MUSK:
No, we're not fucked. I mean, this is quite a complex question.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
You know, we're really just   When we   Themore carbon we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphere, and a lot of it gets
permeated into the oceans, the more dangerous it is. Like I don't think right   Ithink we're okay right now. We can probably even
add some more but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow.

ELON MUSK:
Like there's a vast base of industry, vast transportation system. Like there's Two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world. And
the new car and truck production, if it was a 100% electric, that's only about 100 million per year. So, it would take   If you could
snap your fingers and instantly turn all cars and trucks electric, it would still take 25 years to change the transport base to electric. It
makes sense because how long does a car and truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed  About 20 to 25 years.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there a way to accelerate that process, like some sort of subsidies or some encouragement from the government financially 

ELON MUSK:
Well, the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any oil-burning device. Any power plant or car is
fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, or just the atmosphere for short. So, like, you can say,
okay, there's a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere.

ELON MUSK:
And so, there's some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon into the atmosphere, things overheat, oceans warm up, ice
caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, you know, if something's underwater, but it'snot clear what that number is.
But, definitely, scientists, it's really quite   The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Overwhelming.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, I don't know any serious scientist, actually zero, literally zero who don't think, you know, that we have quite a serious climate
risk that we're facing. And so, that's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing, power plants, aircraft, car
frankly even rockets. I mean, rockets use up   you know, they burn. They burn fuel. But there's just   you know, with rockets, there's
just no other way to get to orbit unfortunately. So, it's the only way.

ELON MUSK:
But with cars, there's definitely a better way with electric cars. And to generate the energy, do so with photovoltaics because we've
got a giant nuclear reactor in the sky called the sun. It's great. It sort of shows up every day, very reliable. So, if you can generate
energy from solar panels, store up with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours a day.

ELON MUSK:
And then, you know, you can send to the polls or in the air tothe north with, you know, high voltage lines. Most of the northern parts
of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well. But, anyway, all fossil fuel-powered things have an inherent subsidy, which is
their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans.

ELON MUSK:
So, people tend to think like why should electric vehicles have a subsidy, but they're not taking into account that all fossil fuel-burning
vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost, the environmental cost to earth, but nobody's paying for it. We are going to pay for
it, obviously. In the future, we'll pay for it. It's just not paid for now.

JOE ROGAN:
And what is the bottleneck in regards to electric cars, and trucks, and things like that  Is it battery capacity 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. You got to scale up production. You got to make the car compelling, make it better than gasoline or diesel cars.

JOE ROGAN:
Make it more efficient in terms of, like, the distance it can travel  You're going to be fueling-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, you're going to be able to go far enough, recharge fast.

JOE ROGAN:
And your Roadster, you're anticipating 600 miles. Is that correct 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
What is it  What is that 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, 600 miles.

JOE ROGAN:
Is that right now  Like have you driven one 600 miles now 

ELON MUSK:
No. We could totally make one right now that would do 600 miles, but the thing is too expensive. So, like the car's got to-

JOE ROGAN:
How much more so 

ELON MUSK:
Well, you know, just have a chartered kilowatt hour battery pack, and you can go 600 miles as long as you're-

JOE ROGAN:
Right, versus what do you have now 

ELON MUSK:
330-mile range. That's plenty for most people.

JOE ROGAN:
330-mile range. And what is that mean in terms of kilowatts 

ELON MUSK:
Well, that would be for Model S, 100-kilowatt hour pack will do about 330 miles. Maybe 335 because some people have hyper mild it
to 500 miles per mile.

JOE ROGAN:
Hyper mild it. What does that mean 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, just like go on-

JOE ROGAN:
45 miles an hour or something 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, like 30 miles an hour or so. It's like on level ground with   You pumpthe tires up really well, and go on a smooth surface, and
you can go for a long time. But, you know, like definitely comfortably do 300 miles.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there any-

ELON MUSK:
This is fine for most people. Usually, 200 or 250 miles is fine. 300 miles is   Youdon't even think about it really.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there any possibility that you could use solar power, solar-powered one day, especially in Los Angeles  I mean, as you said about
that giant nuclear reactor, a million times bigger than Earth just floating in the sky. Is it possible that one day, you'll be able to just
power all these cars just on solar power  I mean, we don't ever have cloudy days if we do just three of them.

ELON MUSK:
Well, the surface area of a car is without making the car look really blocky or having some-

JOE ROGAN:
Like a G wagon.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, and just like if it looked a lot of surface area, or like maybe like solar panels fold out, or something-

JOE ROGAN:
Like your E class. That's what it needed.

ELON MUSK:
That E type 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, the Jaguar E type with a giant long hood, that could be a giant solar panel.

ELON MUSK:
Well, at the beginning of Tesla, I did want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing. They'd press a button, and it would just like
unfold these solar panels, and like charge/recharge your car in the parking lot. Yeah, we could do that, but I think it's probably better
to just put that on your roof.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
And then, it's going to   It should be facing the sun all the time because like-

JOE ROGAN:
What car have that on the roof 

ELON MUSK:
Otherwise, your car could be in the shade. You know, it could be in theshade, it could be in a garage, or something likethat.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Didn't the Fisker have that on the roof  The Fisker Karma New Generation for   I believe, it was only for the radio. Is that correct 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I mean, but I think it could like recharge like two miles a day or something.

JOE ROGAN:
Did you laugh when they started blowing up when they get hit with water  Do you remember what happened 

ELON MUSK:
They got what 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, they had a dealership or-

ELON MUSK:
Oh yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
The Fisker Karmas were parked-

ELON MUSK:
Is that like that with a flood in Jersey 

JOE ROGAN:
Yes, yes.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
When the hurricane came in, they got overwhelmed with water, and they all started exploding. There's a fucking great video of it. Did
you watch the video 

ELON MUSK:
I didn't watch the video, but I did see   It's like some pictureof the aftermath.

JOE ROGAN:
If I was you, I'd be naked, lubedup, watch that video, laugh my ass off. They all blow up. They got wet, and they blew up. That's not
good.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, we made our battery waterproof, so that doesn't happen. Actually-

JOE ROGAN:
Smart move.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, there was a guy in Kazakhstan that   I think it wasKazakhstan that he just boated through a tunnel, an underwater tunnel, like
a flooded tunnel, and just turned the wheels to steer, and pressed the accelerator, and it just floated through the tunnel.

JOE ROGAN:
Wow.

ELON MUSK:
And he steered around the other cars. I mean, like-

JOE ROGAN:
That's amazing.

ELON MUSK:
It's on the internet.

JOE ROGAN:
What happens if your car gets a little sideways, like if you're driving in snow  Like what if you're driving, if you're autopilot is on, and
you're in like Denver, and it snows out, and your car gets a little sideways, does it correct itself  Does that-

ELON MUSK:
Oh yeah. It's got great traction control.

JOE ROGAN:
But does it know how to like correct  You know how, like, when your Ascend-

ELON MUSK:
Oh yeah, sure.

JOE ROGAN:
 kicks, you know how to counter steer 

ELON MUSK:
Oh, yeah. No, it's really good.

JOE ROGAN:
It knows how to do it 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa.

ELON MUSK:
It's pretty crazy.

JOE ROGAN:
That's pretty crazy.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
So, like if you're going sideways, it knows how to correct itself 

ELON MUSK:
It generally won't go sideways.

JOE ROGAN:
It won't 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Why not 

ELON MUSK:
It will correct itself before it goes sideways.

JOE ROGAN:
Even in black eyes 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. There's videos where you could see the car, the traction-

JOE ROGAN:
Not alone.

ELON MUSK:
Traction control system is very good. It makes you feel like Superman. It's great. You like feel like you can   Like it's   Itwill make
you feel like this incredible driver.

JOE ROGAN:
I believe it.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, how do you program that 

ELON MUSK:
We do have testing on like an ice lake in Sweden.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh really 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. And like Norway, and Canada, and a few other places.

JOE ROGAN:
Porsche does a lot of that too  They do-

ELON MUSK:
They did it as well 

JOE ROGAN:
They do a lot of their   They do some of their driver training school on these frozen surfaces. So, you're just   The car is going
sideways whether you like it or not. And you have to learn how to slide into corners, and how do we test.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Electric cars have really great traction control because the reaction time is so fast.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Sort of like where you're gassing a car, you've got a lot of latency. It takes a while for the engine to react, but for electric motors,
incredibly precise. That's why you're like   You imaginelike if you had like a printer or something, you wouldn't have a gasoline
engine printer. That would be pretty weird or like a surgical device. It's going to be an electric motor on the surgical device on the
printer. Gasoline engine's going to be just chugging away. It's not going to have the reaction time.

ELON MUSK:
But to an electric motor, it's operating at the most second level. So, it can turn on and off traction within, like, inches of getting on the
onus. Like, let's say, you're driving on a patch of ice, it will turn traction off, and then turn it on a couple inches right after the ice, like a
little patch of ice because in the frame of the electric motor, you're moving incredibly slowly. You're like a   You're a snail. You're just
moving so slowly because it can see at a thousand frames a second. And so, it's like, say, one Mississippi. It just thought about it
things a thousand times.

JOE ROGAN:
So, it's to realize that your wheels are not getting traction. It understands there's some slippery surface that you're driving on.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And it makes adjustments in real time.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, in milliseconds.

JOE ROGAN:
That would be so much safer than a regular car.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, it is.

JOE ROGAN:
Just that alone, for loved ones, you'd want them to be driving your car.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. The-

JOE ROGAN:
Or on board. Fuck motors. Dude, fuck regularmotors.

ELON MUSK:
That S, X, and 3 have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the US government.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa.

ELON MUSK:
So, this   Yeah, but it's pretty fun. It's pretty crazy. Like we   Youknow, people still sue us like they'll have like some accident at 60
miles an hour where they'd like twisted an ankle, and they slipped. Like they will be dead in another car, they still sue us.

JOE ROGAN:
But that's to be expected, isn't it 

ELON MUSK:
It is to be expected.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you take that into account with like the same sort of fatalistic, you know, undertones to sort of just go, "You've got to just let it go.
This is what people do."

ELON MUSK:
I tell you I've got-

JOE ROGAN:
This is what it is.

ELON MUSK:
 Quite a lot of respect for the justice system. Judges are very smart. And they see   they've   as like I haven't. So far, I've found
judges to be very good at justice because like what   and juries are good too. Like, they're actually quite good. You know, people  
You know, you read about like occasional errors in the justice system. Let me tell you, most the time, they're very good.

ELON MUSK:
And like the other guy mentioned who fell asleep in the car, and he rode over a cyclist. And that was what encouraged me to get
autopilot out as soon as possible. That guy sued us.

JOE ROGAN:
He sued you for falling asleep 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I'm not kidding. He blamed it on the new car smell.

JOE ROGAN:
What 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
He blamed him falling asleep on your new car smell. Does someone that's a lawyer-

ELON MUSK:
This is a real thing that happened.

JOE ROGAN:
Someone that's a lawyer that thought that through in front of his laptop before he wrote that up.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, he got a lawyer, and he sued us, and the judge was like, "This is crazy. Stop bothering me. No."

JOE ROGAN:
Thank God.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Thank God. Thank God there's a judge outthere with a brain.

ELON MUSK:
I tell you, judges are very good.

JOE ROGAN:
Some of them.

ELON MUSK:
I have a lot of-

JOE ROGAN:
What about that judge that sent all these boys up the river in Pennsylvania who was selling those kids out  You know aboutthat
story 

ELON MUSK:
Nope.

JOE ROGAN:
Judge was selling young boys to prisons. He was like literally-

ELON MUSK:
What 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, literally, under bribes for   He was-

ELON MUSK:
Was this an elected judge or-

JOE ROGAN:
He was-

ELON MUSK:
Because sometimes you have a judge that's like actually a politician.

JOE ROGAN:
No, he was a elected judge. This is a very famous story.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
He's in jail right now, I think, for the rest of his life. And he put away   Hewould take like a young boy who would do something like
steal something from a store, and he would put them in detention for, you know, five years. Something ridiculous egregious. And
they investigated his history. And they found out that he was literally being paid off. Was it by private prisons  Is that what the the
deal was  There was some sort of  But, anyway, this judge is-
 
JOE ROGAN:
Two judges 
 
JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.
 
JOE ROGAN:
And who was paying them  Someone   It proven to the point where they're in jail now that someone was paying them to put more
asses in the seats in these private prisons.
 
JOE ROGAN:
A million-dollar payment 
 
ELON MUSK:
I do think these private prisons thing is-

JOE ROGAN:
Someone business.

ELON MUSK:
 creating a bad incentive.

JOE ROGAN:
It's dark.

ELON MUSK:
Right, yes. But, I mean, that judge is in prison.

JOE ROGAN:
Thank God.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, but for people who think perhaps the justice system consists entirely of judges like that, I want to assure you-

JOE ROGAN:
No.

ELON MUSK:
 this is not the case. The vast majority of judges are very good.

JOE ROGAN:
I agree.

ELON MUSK:
And they care about justice, and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to be a trial lawyer. And instead, they cared
about justice, and they made less money because they care about justice. And that's why they're judges.

JOE ROGAN:
I feel that same way about police officers.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
I feel like there's so many interactions with so many different people with police officers that the very few that stand out that are
horrific, we tend to look at that like, "This is evidence that police are all corrupt." And I think that's crazy.

ELON MUSK:
No. Most police are very honest.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
And like the military-

JOE ROGAN:
Like they have an insanely-

ELON MUSK:
 personnel that I know-

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
 are very honorable, ethical people.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
And much more honorable and ethical than the average person. That's my impression.

JOE ROGAN:
I agree. That's my impression as well.

ELON MUSK:
And that's not to suggest that we be complacent and assume everyone is honest and ethical. And, obviously, if somebody is given a
trusted place in society, such as being a police officer or a judge, and they are corrupt, then we must be extra vigilant against such
situations-

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
 and take action. But we should not think that this is somehow broadly descriptive of people in that profession.

JOE ROGAN:
I couldn't agree more. I think there's also an issue with one of the things that happens with police officers, prosecutors, and anyone
that's trying to convict someone or arrest someone is that it becomes a game. And in games, people want to win.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And sometimes, people cheat.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, yes. I mean, you know, if you're a prosecutor, you should not always want to win. There are times when you should like, "Okay. I
just should not want to win this case." And then, you know, like just pass on that case. Sometimes, people want to win too much.
That is true.

ELON MUSK:
I think, also, it becomes tough. If you're like a district attorney, you know, you tend to sort of see a lot of criminals. And then, your
view of the world can get negatively.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
You know, have a negative   You know, you can have a negative view of the world because, you know, you're just interacting with a
lot of criminals. But, actually, most of society is not to consist of criminals.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
And I, actually, had this conversation at dinner several years ago with, I guess, it's Tony.I was like, "Man, it must, sometimes, seem
pretty, pretty dark because, you know, man, there's some terrible human beings out there. And he was like, "Yup." And he was like
dealing with some case, which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would run people over somehow for insurance money. It was
rough. Like, "Wow, that's pretty rough." It's like hard to maintain faith in humanity if you're a district attorney, but, you know, it's only a
few percent of society that are actually bad.

ELON MUSK:
And then if you go to the worst, say 0.1% of society are the worst, one in a thousand, one in a million, you know. Like how bad is the
millionth worst person in the United States  Pretty damn bad. Like damn evil.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah,

ELON MUSK:
Like the millionth, well, one in a million of evil is so evil, people cannot even conceive of it. But there's 330 million people in the United
States. So, that's 330 people out there somewhere. But by the same token, there's also 330 people who are incredible angels and
unbelievably good human beings.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
On the other side.

JOE ROGAN:
But because of our fear of danger, we tend to   our thoughts tend to gravitate towards the worst-case scenario.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
And we want to frame that. And that's one of the real problems with prejudice, whether it's prejudice towards different minorities, or
prejudice towards police officers, or anything, it's like we want to look at the worst-case scenario and say, "This is an example of what
this is all about.".

JOE ROGAN:
And you see that even with people, how they frame genders. Some men frame women like that. They get ripped off by a few women,
and they said, "All women are evil." Some women get fucked over by a few men, "All men are shit." And this is very toxic.

ELON MUSK:
It is.

JOE ROGAN:
And it's also   It's a very unbalanced way of viewing the world, and it's very emotionally-based, and it's based on your own
experience, your own anecdotal experience. And it can be very influential to the people around you, and it's just it's a dangerous way.
It's a dangerous thought process and pattern to promote.

ELON MUSK:
It is. It is a very dangerous, but I really think, you know, people should give other people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they
are good until proven otherwise. And, I think,really, most people are actually pretty good people. Nobody's perfect.

JOE ROGAN:
They have to be.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
If you think of vast numbers of us that are just interacting with each other constantly-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
 we have to be better than we think we are.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I mean, like-

JOE ROGAN:
There's no other way.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, here are these weapons but how many times, like, nobody's presumably try to murder you and you're-

JOE ROGAN:
Nobody yet.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, nobody. It's like the sword right there.

JOE ROGAN:
Not the flamethrower, fake flamethrower here-

ELON MUSK:
Exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
It's not a flamethrower. Now, we've got a real problem, I'm going to put it on that side to him and leave it for the guests.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
I'm like, "Look, man, if I say something that fucked up, it's right there."

ELON MUSK:
It will liven things up for sure. It's guaranteed to make any party better.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Well, that's   I mean, that's the armed civilization theory, right. An armed community is safe and polite community.

ELON MUSK:
You know, in Texas, it's kind of true. Yeah. I mean-

JOE ROGAN:
People in Texas are super polite. Therefore, they've got a gun.

ELON MUSK:
Yes. Don't make somebody angry.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
We don't know what's going to happen.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it's a good move.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Piss people off, and everybody are going to have a gun.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
You're off to just let that guy get in your lane.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. You know, we got a big test site in Central Texas near Waco.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh yeah  Beautiful.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, Space X in McGregor. It's about 15 minutes away from Waco.

JOE ROGAN:
That's close to where Ted Nugent lives.

ELON MUSK:
It is 

JOE ROGAN:
Shout out to Ted Nugent.

ELON MUSK:
Okay, cool.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, there's   Youknow, we have lots of fire, and loud explosions, and things, and people-

JOE ROGAN:
I bet.

ELON MUSK:
 they are cool with it.

JOE ROGAN:
They don't give a fuck out there.

ELON MUSK:
They're very supportive.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. You can buy fireworks where, you know, your kids go to school.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. You know, it's dangerous.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, but it's free.

ELON MUSK:
It's free.

JOE ROGAN:
There's something about Texas-

ELON MUSK:
Exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
 that's very enticing because of that. It is dangerous, but it's also free.

ELON MUSK:
Right.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I kind of like Texas actually.

JOE ROGAN:
I prefer it over places that are more restrictive but more liberal because you could always be liberal. Like just because things are free
and just because you have a certain amount of, you know, right wing type characters, it doesn't mean you have to be that way, you
know.

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
And, honestly, there's a lot of those people that are pretty fucking open minded and let you do whatever you want to do.

ELON MUSK:
Right.

JOE ROGAN:
As long as you don't bother them.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
That's my hope right now with the way we're able to communicate with each other today and how radically different it is than
generations past because we all   Just, the dust settles. We all realize, like what you're saying that most people are good.
 
JOE ROGAN:
The vast majority 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I think if you give people the benefit of doubt, for sure.

JOE ROGAN:
I think you're right. You know who could help with that  Mushrooms.

ELON MUSK:
Mushrooms.

JOE ROGAN:
Don't you think 

ELON MUSK:
They're delicious.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, right.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
They're good for you too.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
All of them. All kinds of them. What do you see in terms of, like, when you think about the future of your companies, what do you see
is like bottlenecks  Want some more of this 

ELON MUSK:
Sure. Thank you.

JOE ROGAN:
What do you see in terms of like bottlenecks of things that are holding back innovation  Is it regulatory commissions and people that
don't understand the technology that are influencing policy  Like what could potentially be holding you guys back right now  Is there
anything that you would change 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I wish politicians were better at science. That would help a lot.

JOE ROGAN:
That's a problem.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
There's no incentive for them to be good at science.

ELON MUSK:
There isn't. Actually, you know, they're pretty good at science in China, I have to say.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. The mayor of Beijing has, I believe, an environmental engineering degree, and the deputy mayor has a physics degree. I met
them, And Mayor says, "Shanghai is really smart and-".

JOE ROGAN:
You're up on technology. What do you think about this government policy of stopping use of Huawei phones  And there's something
about the the worry about spying. I mean, from what I understand from real tech people, they think it's horseshit.

ELON MUSK:
Oh I-.

JOE ROGAN:
Like phones.

ELON MUSK:
I don't know. I don't know.

JOE ROGAN:
Like the government say, "Don't you buy Huawei phones." Are you up on that at all  No  Should we just abandon this idea 

ELON MUSK:
Well, I think, like, I guess, if you have like top secret stuff, then you want to be pretty careful about what hardware you use. But, you
know, like most people do not have top secret stuff.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
And, like, nobody really cares what porn you watch like, you know.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
It's like nobody actually cares, you know. So-.

JOE ROGAN:
If they do, that's kind of them.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It's just like-

ELON MUSK:
National spy agencies do not give a rat's ass which porn you watch. They do not care. So, like, what secrets does a national spy
agency have to learn from the average citizen  Nothing.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, that's the argument against the narrative. And the argument by a lot of these tech people is that the real concern is that these
companies, like Huawei, are innovating at a radical pace, and they're trying to stop them from integrating into our culture and letting
this. Like right now, they're the number two cell phone manufacturer in the world.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
Samsung is number one. Huawei is number two. Apple is now number three. They surpassed Apple as number two. And the idea is
that this is all taking place without them having any foothold whatsoever in America. There's no carriers that have their phones. You
have to buy their phones unlocked through some sort of a third party, and then put-

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
And the worry is, you know, that these are somehow another controlled by the Chinese government. The Communist Chinese
government is going to distribute these phones. And I don't know if the worry's economic influence or they'll have too much power. I
don't know what it is. Are you paying attention on any of this 

ELON MUSK:
Not really.

JOE ROGAN:
No 

ELON MUSK:
I don't think we should worry too much about Huawei phones, you know. Maybe, you know, a national security agency shouldn't
have Huawei phones. Maybe that's a question mark. But I think for the average citizen, this doesn't matter. Just like no, they're not.
I'm pretty sure the Chinese government does not care about the goings of the average American citizen.

JOE ROGAN:
Is there a time where you think that there will be no security, it will be impossible to hold back information that whatever bottleneck
we'll let go, we're going to give in  That whatever bottleneck between privacy and ultimate innovation will have to be bridged in order
for us to achieve the next level of technological proficiency that we're just going to abandon it, and there'll be no security, no privacy 

ELON MUSK:
Do people want privacy  Because they seem to put everything on the internet. Practically-.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, right now, they are confused, but when you're talking about your Neuralink, and this this idea that one day, we're going to be
able to share information, and we're going to be some sort of a thing that's symbiotically connected 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I think we really worry about security in that situation

JOE ROGAN:
And when-

ELON MUSK:
For sure. That's like security will be paramount.

JOE ROGAN:
Sure.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
But, also, what we will be. This will be so much different. Our concerns about money, about status, about where all of these things
will seemingly go by the wayside if we really become enlightened, if we really become artificially enlightened by some sort of an AI
interface where we have this symbiotic relationship with some new internet type connection to information  But, you know, what
happens then  What is important  What is not important  Is privacy important when we're all gods 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, I think the things that we think are important to keep private right now-

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
 we probably will not think going forward.

JOE ROGAN:
Shame, right  Information, right  What are hiding  Emotions  What are we hiding 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, I think, like, I don't know. Maybe it's like embarrassing stuff.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, embarrassing stuff.

ELON MUSK:
But there's actually   Like, I think, people, there's like not that much that's kept private that people   that is actually relevant.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
That other people would actually care about. When you think other people care about it, but they don't really care about it. And,
certainly, governments don't.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, some people care about it. But, then, it gets weird when it gets exposed. Like Jennifer Lawrence, when those naked pictures
got exposed, like, I think, in some ways, people liked her more.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
They realized like she's just a person. It's just a girl who likes sex, and is just alive, and has a boyfriend, and sends him messages.
And, now, you get to look into it, and you probably shouldn't have, but somebody let it go, and they put it online, and all right.

ELON MUSK:
She seems to be doing okay.

JOE ROGAN:
She's a person. She's just you, and me, and it's the same thing. She's just in some weird place where she's on a 35-foot tall screen
with music playing every time she talks.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure like not-

JOE ROGAN:
No, but she's fine.

ELON MUSK:
She's not happy about it, but she's-

JOE ROGAN:
No.

ELON MUSK:
But she's clearly doing fine.

JOE ROGAN:
But once this interface is fully realized where we really do become something far more powerful in terms of our cognitive ability, our
ability to understand irrational thoughts, and mitigate them, and that we're all connected in some sort of an insane way. I mean, what
are our thoughts on wealth, our thoughts on social status  Like how many of those just evaporate  And our need for privacy, maybe
our need for privacy will be the ultimate bottleneck that we'll have to surpass.

ELON MUSK:
I think, the things that we think are important now will probably not be important in the future, but therewill be things that are
important. It's just, like, different things.

JOE ROGAN:
What will be more important 

ELON MUSK:
I don't know. There might be some more of ideas potentially. I don't think Darwin's going away.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Darwin's going to be there.

JOE ROGAN:
That was that, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Darwin will be there forever.

JOE ROGAN:
Forever, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
It would just be a different arena. Different arena.

JOE ROGAN:
A digital arena.

ELON MUSK:
Different arena. Darwin is not going away.

JOE ROGAN:
What keeps you up at night 

ELON MUSK:
Well, it's quite hard to run companies.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Especially car companies, I would say. It's quite challenging.

JOE ROGAN:
The car business is the hardest one of all the things you do 

JOE ROGAN:
Yes, because it's a consumer-oriented business as opposed to like SpaceX and-

ELON MUSK:
Not that SpaceX because SpaceX is no walk in the park, but a car company, it's very difficult to keep a car company alive. It's very
difficult. You know, there's only two companies in the history of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt, and that's Ford
and Tesla. That's it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, Ford rode out that crazy storm, huh  They're the only one.

ELON MUSK:
By the skin of theirteeth.

JOE ROGAN:
Shot out to the Mustang.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, by the skin of their teeth. That is interesting, right 

ELON MUSK:
Same with Tesla, we barely survived.

JOE ROGAN:
How close did you get to folding 

ELON MUSK:
Very close. I mean, 2008 is not a good time to be a car company, especially a startup car company, and especially an electric car
company. That was like stupidity squared.

JOE ROGAN:
And this is when you had those cool Roadsters with the T-top 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
With a target top 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. We had like a   It was highlymodified Elise chassis. The body was completely different. By the way, that was a super dumb
strategy that we actually did because we-

JOE ROGAN:
What's dumb 

ELON MUSK:
It was based on two false premises. One false premise was that we would be able to cheaply convert the Lotus Elise, and use that as
a car platform, and that we'll be able to use technology from this little company called AC Propulsion for the electric drive train on the
battery. Premise, the AC propulsion technology did not work in production, and we ended up using none of it in long-term. None of it.
We had to resign everything.

ELON MUSK:
And then once you add a battery pack and electric motor to the car, it got heavier. It got 30% heavier. It invalidated the entire
structure, all the crash structure. Everything had to be redone. Nothing. Like, I think, it had less than 7% of the parts were common
with any other device including cars or anything.

JOE ROGAN:
7% 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Everything  Including tires, and wheels, bolts, brakes 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, even every-

JOE ROGAN:
Steering wheel  Seat 

ELON MUSK:
The steering wheel was  I think, the steering wheel was almost the same. Yes, the windscreen. The windscreen.

JOE ROGAN:
Different 

ELON MUSK:
No. I think, the windscreen is the same.

JOE ROGAN:
Same 

ELON MUSK:
Yes. I think, we were able to keep the windscreen.

JOE ROGAN:
But the last was 7%. So, that's basically-

ELON MUSK:
Every body panel is different. The entire structure was different. We couldn't use the, like, the HVAC system, the air conditioner. It
was belt-driven air conditioner. So, now, we needed something that was electrically driven. We need a new AC compressor.

JOE ROGAN:
And all that takes away from the battery life as well, right 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. We need a small highly efficient air conditioning system that fit in a tiny car and was electrically powered, not belt-driven. It
was very difficult.

JOE ROGAN:
How much of those weigh, those cars, the Roadster 

ELON MUSK:
I think it was 2700 pounds.

JOE ROGAN:
That's still very light.

ELON MUSK:
27. Depending on which version, 2650 to 2750 pounds, something like that.

JOE ROGAN:
And what was the weight distribution 

ELON MUSK:
It was about 50   Well, there were different versions of the car. So, it's about 55 on the rear.

JOE ROGAN:
That's not bad.

ELON MUSK:
It was rear bias.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, but not bad. Considering like a 911, which is like one of the most popular sports cars of all time. Heavy rear end bias.

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean, yeah. The 911, I'm not going to joke,is like the master despite Newton not being on their side.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
I guess, fighting Newton, it's very difficult.

JOE ROGAN:
Well-

ELON MUSK:
It's like you've got those   The moments of inertia on a 911 don't make any sense.

JOE ROGAN:
They do once you understand them. Once you understand-

ELON MUSK:
You don't want to hang the engine off the ass. This is not a wise move.

JOE ROGAN:
You don't want to let up on the gas when you're in a corner.

ELON MUSK:
The problem with something where the engine is mounted over the rear axle or off the rear axle towards the rear is that your polar
moment of inertia is fundamentally screwed. You cannot solve this. It's unsolvable. You're screwed. Polar moment of inertia,you're
screwed.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Like, essentially, if you spawn the car like a top, that's your polar moment of inertia. You're just   Ipromise I wouldn't swear on this
show, by the way.

JOE ROGAN:
Really 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Says who 

ELON MUSK:
This was for a friend.

JOE ROGAN:
Tell that friend to go fuck himself. Who told you not to swear 

ELON MUSK:
A friend.

JOE ROGAN:
He's not a good friend.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
That friend need to-

ELON MUSK:
I said I wouldn't swear.

JOE ROGAN:
 realize you're fucking Elon Musk. You can do whatever you want, man. If you ever get confused, call me.

ELON MUSK:
I'll swear in private. Swear up a storm.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay, just say freaking. It's a fun way. It's like old house moms. Wives and shit that have children, "Oh, this freaking thing."

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. But, anyway, like the Portia, it's kind of incredible how well Porsche handles given that it's the physics-.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
The moments of inertia are so messed up. To actually still make it work well is incredible.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, if you know how to turn into the corner once you get used to the feeling of it, there's actual benefits to it. You know, there are
some benefits.

ELON MUSK:
I enjoy. The car I had before, Tesla was a 911.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
That was-

JOE ROGAN:
997 or 6 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
997 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Great car, man.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, particularly, the Porsche wouldn't have the variable veins on the turbo, and it didn't have the turbo lag. That was great.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
That was really great. The turbo lag is, like, you know, if you flirt, like phone home, call your mom.

JOE ROGAN:
The older one, right 

ELON MUSK:
It's like about an hour later-

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
 the car accelerates.

JOE ROGAN:
And super dangerous too because where it will start spinning and-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. There's something fun about it though like feeling that rear weight kicking around, you know. And again-

ELON MUSK:
No, it's great.

JOE ROGAN:
 it's not efficient.

ELON MUSK:
It had a good feel to it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I agree.

JOE ROGAN:
But that's what I was talking about earlier about that little car that I have, the '93 911. It's not fast. It's not the best handling car, but it's
more satisfying than any other car I have because it's so mechanical. It's like everything about it, like crack holes, and bumps, and it
gives you all this feedback. And I take it to the comic store because when I get there, I feel like my brain is just popping, and it's on
fire. It's like a strategy for me now that I really stop driving other cars there. I drive that car there just for the brain juice, just for the-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
The interaction.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, you should try Model S P100D.

JOE ROGAN:
I'll try it.

ELON MUSK:
It will blow your mind-

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
 and your skull.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Tell me what to order, I'll order it.

ELON MUSK:
Model S P100D.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay. Jamie, write it down.

ELON MUSK:
That's the car that I drive.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay. Okay, I'll get the car you drive. Okay.

ELON MUSK:
It will blow your mind-

JOE ROGAN:
How far can I drive 

ELON MUSK:
 out of your skull.

JOE ROGAN:
I believe you.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
How far can I drive  How far can I drive 

ELON MUSK:
About 300 miles.

JOE ROGAN:
That's good. For LA regular days, that's good.

ELON MUSK:
You will never notice the battery.

JOE ROGAN:
Never 

ELON MUSK:
Never.

JOE ROGAN:
How hard is it to get like one of them crazy plugs installed in your house  That difficult 

ELON MUSK:
No, it's super easy. It's like, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you-

ELON MUSK:
It's like a dryer plug. It's like a dryer outlet.

JOE ROGAN:
Didn't you come up with some crazy tiles for your roof that are solar paneled 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. I have it on my roof right now actually. I'm just trying it out. The thing is it takes a while to test roof stuff because roofs
have to last a long time.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
So, like, you want your roof to last like 30 years.

JOE ROGAN:
Could you put it over a regular roof 

ELON MUSK:
No. So, there's two versions. It's like the solar panels you put on a roof. So, like, it depends on whether your roofs new or old. So, if
your roofs new, you don't want to replace the roof. You want to put like solar panels on the roof.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
So, that's like retrofit, you know. And they were trying to make the retrofit panels look real nice. But then, the new product were
coming out with it is if you have a roof that's either you're building a house or you're going to replace your roof anyway, then you
make the tiles have solar cells embedded in the tiles.

ELON MUSK:
And then, it's quite a tricky thing because you want to not see the solar cell behind the glass tile. So, you have to really work with the
glass, and the various coatings, and the layers, so that you don't see the solar cells behind the glass. Otherwise, it doesn't look right.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
So, it's really tricky.

JOE ROGAN:
There it is.
ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Man, that looks good. Is there a-

ELON MUSK:
See, like, if you look closely, you can see. If you zoom in, like, you can see the cell. But if you zoom out, you don't see the cell.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, but it looks though.

ELON MUSK:
See 

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Like that's hard.

JOE ROGAN:
That's invisible solar cells.

ELON MUSK:
It's really hard because you have to get the sunlight go through.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
But when it gets reflected back out, it doesn't   it hides the fact that there's a cell there.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, are those available to the consumer right now 

ELON MUSK:
Well, we have   I think, that's-

JOE ROGAN:
Those on that roof right there 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
That's amazing. Oh, that looks good.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Ooh, I like that.

ELON MUSK:
That one is hard.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh. So, you get that kind of fake Spanish looking thing. I like that.

ELON MUSK:
That's French slate.

JOE ROGAN:
That's why people in Connecticut are smoking pipes. Look at that one.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
That's badass, dude. So, now-

ELON MUSK:
This will actually work.

JOE ROGAN:
I believe you. So, the solar panels that are on that house that we just looked at, is that sufficient to power the entire home 

ELON MUSK:
It depends on your energy on how efficient-

JOE ROGAN:
Expenditure 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
So, generally, yes. I would say it's probably for most. It's going to vary, but anywhere from more than you need to maybe half. Like
call it half to 1.5 of the energy that you need, depending on how much roof you have relative to living space.

JOE ROGAN:
And how ridiculous you are with your TV.

ELON MUSK:
TVs no problem. Air conditioning.

JOE ROGAN:
Air conditioning.

ELON MUSK:
Air conditioning is the problem. If you have an efficient air conditioner, and you don't   and depending on how   like, areyou air
conditioning rooms when they don't need to be air conditioned, which is very common-

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
 because it's a pain in the neck, you know. It's like programming a VCR. It's like-

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Now, it's just blinking 12:00. So, people are just like, "The hell withthat. I'm just going to make it this temperature all day long.".

JOE ROGAN:
Right. You know how asmart home where if you're in the room, then it stays cool, right 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it should predict when you're going to be home, and then cool the rooms that you're likely to use with a little bit of intelligence.
We're not talking about like genius home here. We're talking like elementary basic stuff.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
You know, like if you could hook that into the car, like manage you coming home. Like there's no point cooling thehome-

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
 keeping the home really cool when you're not there.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
But it can tell that you're coming home, it's just going to cool it to the right temperature right when you get there.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you have an app that works with your solar panels or anything like that 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

JOE ROGAN:
And-.

ELON MUSK:
But we need to hook it into the air conditioning to really make the air conditioning work.

JOE ROGAN:
Have you thought about creating an air conditioning system  I know you have. Trick question.

ELON MUSK:
Cannot answer questions about the future of potential products.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay. Let's just let it go. We'll move on to the next thing.

ELON MUSK:
That would be an interesting idea.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I would say radiant heating and all that, good ideas. Now, when you think about the efficiency of these homes, and you think
about implementing solar power and battery power, is there anything else that people are missing  Is there any other   Like, I just
saw a smartwatch that is powered by the heat of the human body, and some new technology.

ELON MUSK:
It's able to fully power that way 

JOE ROGAN:
I don't know-

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
 if it's fully or if it's   Like this watch right here, this is a Casio.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
It's called a Pro Trek. And it's like an outdoors watch, and it's solar-powered.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
And so, it has the ability to operate for a certain amount of time on solar.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
So, if you have it exposed, it could function for a certain amount of time on solar.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Well, you know, like there's self-weighting watches where-

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
 you know, it's just got a weight in thewatch. And as you move your wrist, the way it moves from one side to the other, and it winds
the watch up. That's a pretty cool thing.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, it's amazing that like Rolexes that it's all done mechanically.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
There's no batteries in there. There is no nothing.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. You could do the same thing. You create a little charger that's based on wrist movement. It really depends on how much
energy your watch uses.

JOE ROGAN:
You know what's fucked up about that though  We accept a certain amount of like fuckery with those watches. Like I brought my
watch. I have a Rolex that my friend, Lorenzo, gave me, and I brought it to the watch store, and I said, "This thing's always fast." I
said, "It's always like after a couple of months, it's like five minutes fast." And they go, "Yup." They go, "Yeah."

ELON MUSK:
Really 

JOE ROGAN:
"It's just what it does."

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
I go, "Hold on." I go, "So, you're telling me that it just is always going to be fast " They're like, "Yeah. It'sjust like every few months,
you get like reset it."

ELON MUSK:
It seems like they should recalibrate that thing.

JOE ROGAN:
They can't. They tried. They say, every few months, whether it's four months, or five months, or six months, it's going to be a couple
of minutes fast.

ELON MUSK:
Okay. It seems like they should really recalibrate that because-

JOE ROGAN:
You should figure that shit out.

ELON MUSK:
 if it's always fast, you can just-

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
 you know, delete those minutes.

JOE ROGAN:
You need to fucking kick down the door at Rolex and go,"You bitches are lazy."

ELON MUSK:
It's kind of amazing that you can keep time mechanically on a wristwatch with these tiny little gears.

JOE ROGAN:
It's amazing.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.
 
ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
And they live  - Like lookat this thing, how much is that when 
JOE ROGAN:
These are fucking preposterous guess. I like gears. I love them. I love them.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I think that is beautiful.

JOE ROGAN:
But there's some of these people that are just taking it right in the ass. They'rebuying these watches for like $750,000 . Like, "Yeah,
that's a Timex, son." Nobody knows. It's not any better than some Casio that you could just buy on   Like, look atthat though.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, here's the thing. If you're a person that doesn't just want to know the time, you want craftsmanship, you want some artisan's
touch, you want innovation in terms of like a person figuring out how gears and cogs all line up perfectly, to every time it turns over,
it's basically a second. I mean, that's just   There's this art to that.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I agree.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it's not just telling time. Yeah, I like this watch a lot, but if it got hit by a rock, I wouldn't be sad.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It's just to watch. It's a mass-produced thing that runs on some quartz battery. But those things, there's art to that.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. No, I agree. It's beautiful.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Love it.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. There's something amazing about it. It's-

ELON MUSK:
Right.

JOE ROGAN:
Because it represents the human creativity. It's not just electronic innovation. There's something. It's a person's work in that.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
You don't have a watch on.

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Ever 

ELON MUSK:
I used to have a watch.

JOE ROGAN:
What happened 

ELON MUSK:
My phone tells the time. So-

JOE ROGAN:
That's a good point. Well, if you lose your phone  Do you   Wait, hold on.

ELON MUSK:
It's true.

JOE ROGAN:
Let me guess, you are a no case guy.

ELON MUSK:
That's correct. Living on the edge. Living on the edge without a case.

JOE ROGAN:
Neil deGrasse Tyson. Neil deGrasse Tyson was in here last week. I'm marveled at his ability to get through life without a case.

ELON MUSK:
That's right.

JOE ROGAN:
You know, he takes his phone, and he flips it in between hisfingers like a soldier would do with his rifle.

ELON MUSK:
Right.

JOE ROGAN:
He just rolls that shit in between his fingers.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
It's marvelous.

ELON MUSK:
Wow.

JOE ROGAN:
He says that's the reason why they do it. He said, "Would you look at someone who has a rifle, why would they do that  Why would
they flip it around like that "

ELON MUSK:
Right.

JOE ROGAN:
It's like, it goes to drop, they have it in their hand. They catch it quickly.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
So, that's what he does with his phone. He's just flipping his phone around all the time. I got that in Mexico. I was hoping it holds joint.

ELON MUSK:
Does it do anything  It tips to open.

JOE ROGAN:
No.

ELON MUSK:
Just a hole 

JOE ROGAN:
It's just a hole.

ELON MUSK:
You could store things in there.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. But like try it. Put a joint in there. Close it. You put like one blunt. One, that seems pretentious. You know, that's the idea
behind it. I bought it when I was in Mexico because I figured it would be a good size to hold joints, or it's not.

ELON MUSK:
So, is that a joint or is it a cigar 

JOE ROGAN:
No.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
It's marijuana inside of a tobacco.

ELON MUSK:
Okay. So, it's like posh, part tobacco a pot.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. You never had that 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I think I tried one once.

JOE ROGAN:
Come on, man. You probably can't because of stockholders, right 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, it's legal, right 

JOE ROGAN:
Totally legal.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
How does that work  Do people get upset at you if you do certain things  It's just tobacco and marijuana in there. That's all it is. The
combination of tobacco and marijuana is wonderful. First turned on to it by Charlie Murphy, and then reignited by Dave Chappelle.
There you go.
 
ELON MUSK:
Exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
Perfect. It balances it out.

ELON MUSK:
Alcohol is a drug that's been grandfathered in.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, it's not just a drug. It's a drug that gets a bad rep because you just have a little, it's great.

ELON MUSK:
Fine.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, little sip here and there, and your inhibitions are relaxed, and it shows your true self. And, hopefully, you're more joyous, and
friendly, and happy, and everything. The real worry is the people that can't handle it. Like the real worry about people who can't
handle cars and go 016 in 1.9 seconds or anything.

JOE ROGAN:
Have you ever considered something that   Like, imagine if one day, everyone has a car that's on the same, at least, technological
standard as one of your cars, and everyone agrees that the smart thing to do is not just to have bumpers but to perhaps have some
sort of a magnetic repellent device, something, some electromagnetic field around the cars that as cars come close to each other,
they automatically radically decelerate because of magnets or something.

ELON MUSK:
Well, I mean, our cars brake automatically.

JOE ROGAN:
Brake 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. When they see things 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
But like a physical barrier, like-

ELON MUSK:
Well, the wheels work pretty well.

JOE ROGAN:
The wheels do.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. They work pretty well. Decelerated at, you know, 1.1 to 1.2 Gs,that kind of thing.

JOE ROGAN:
Is your concern that one day all your cars will be on the road, and then, there'll still be regular people with regular cars 20-30 years
from now that will get in the mix and be the main problem 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I think, it'd be sort of like, you know, there was atime of transition where there were horses and gasoline cars on the road at
the same time. It's been pretty weird.

JOE ROGAN:
That would be the weirdest.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, horses were tricky. You know, back when Manhattan had like 300.000 horses, then figure out like if a horse lives 15
years, you got 20,000 horses dropping dead every day or every year, I should say. Every year, it's 20,000 horses. If there's 300,000
horses in a 15-year lifespan.

JOE ROGAN:
Back in the Gangs of New York days, that movie.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
It's a lot of dead horses. You neededa horse to move the horse.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
They'll probably get pretty freaked out if they have to move our dead horse.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think they knowwhat's going on 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think it's as hard 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, it's got to be like prettyweird.

JOE ROGAN:
No, I would imagine.

ELON MUSK:
Like, in my mind, draggingthis dead, you know, horse around, and I'm a horse.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you-

ELON MUSK:
They might not like it.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you ever stop and think about your role in civilization  Do you ever stop and think about your role in the culture  Because me, as
a person, who never met you until today, when I think of you, you know, I've always thought of you as being this weirdo super
inventor dude who just somehow or another keeps coming up with new shit, but there's not a lot of you out there. Like everybody else
seems to be   I mean, obviously, you make a lot of money, and there's a lot of people that make a lot of money. You like that clock 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Pretty dope, right 

ELON MUSK:
This is a great clock.

JOE ROGAN:
You want one  I'll get you one.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay, done.

ELON MUSK:
I like weird things like this.

JOE ROGAN:
Oh, this is the coolest. It's TGT Promotion.What is this  TGT Studios  TGT Studios.
 
JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. So, a gentleman who makes all this by hand. Yeah, it's really cool.

ELON MUSK:
My study is filled with weird devices.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, get ready for another one.

ELON MUSK:
All right.

JOE ROGAN:
I'm sending it your way.

ELON MUSK:
Cool.

JOE ROGAN:
You want a werewolf too  I'll hook you up.

ELON MUSK:
All right. I'll take one.

JOE ROGAN:
Okay. You want a werewolf and one clock coming up. Do you think about your role in the culture  Because me, as a person, who
never met you until today, I've always looked at you and like, "Wow." Like, "How does this guy just keep inventing shit " Like, how do
you how do you keep coming up with all these new devices  And do you ever consider how unusual   Like I had a dream once that
there was a million Teslas. Instead of like one Tesla, there was a million Teslas.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
Not just the car but Nikola.

ELON MUSK:
Oh, yeah, sure.

JOE ROGAN:
And that in his day, there was a million people like him who were radically innovative.

ELON MUSK:
Wow.

JOE ROGAN:
It was a weird dream, man. It was so strange. And I've had it more than once.

ELON MUSK:
That would result in a very rapid technology innovation. That's for sure.

JOE ROGAN:
It's one of the only dreams of my life I've had more than one time.

ELON MUSK:
Okay, wow.

JOE ROGAN:
Like where I've woken up, and it's in the same dream. I'm in the same dream. And in this dream, it's 1940s, 1950s, but everyone is
severely advanced. There's flying blimps with like LCD screens in the side of them. And everything is bizarre and strange. And it
stuck with me for whatever   Obviously, this is just a stupid dream. But for whatever reason, all these years, that stuck with being.
Like it takes one man, like Nikola Tesla, to have more than a hundred inventions that were patents, right. I mean, he had some-

ELON MUSK:
He's pretty great.

JOE ROGAN:
 pretty fucking amazing ideas.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
But there was-

ELON MUSK:
Definitely.

JOE ROGAN:
In his day, there was very few people like him.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, that was true.

JOE ROGAN:
What if there was a million  Like what in the experience-

ELON MUSK:
Things would advance very quickly.

JOE ROGAN:
Right, but there's not a million Elon Musks. There's one motherfucker. Do you think about that or you just try to not 

ELON MUSK:
I don't think. I don't think you'd necessarily want to be me. That'd be good.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, what's the worst part about you 

ELON MUSK:
I should. I never thoughtpeople would like it that much.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, most people would, but they can't be. So, that's like some superhero type shit. You know, we wouldn't wantto be Spiderman.
I'd rather just sleep tight in Gotham City and hope he's out there doing his job.

ELON MUSK:
It's very hard to turn it off.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. What's the hardest part 

ELON MUSK:
It might sound great if it's turned on,but what if it doesn't turn off 

JOE ROGAN:
Now, I showed you the isolation tank, and you've never experienced that before.

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
I think that could help you turn it off a little bit just for the night.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Just give you a little bit of sleep, a little bit of perspective. It's magnesium that you get from the water as well that makes you
sleep easier because the water has Epsom salts in it. But maybe some sort of strategy for sacrificing your   or not sacrificing but
enhancing your biological recovery time by figuring out a way whether it's through meditation or some other ways to shut off that thing
at night. Like you must have like a constant stream of ideas that's running through your head all the time. You're getting text
messages from chicks.

ELON MUSK:
No. I'm getting text messages from a friend saying, "What the hell are you doing smoking weed ".

JOE ROGAN:
Is that bad for you  It's legal.
 
ELON MUSK:
I mean-

JOE ROGAN:
It's government approved.

ELON MUSK:
It's not   You know, I'm not a regular smoker of weed.

JOE ROGAN:
How often do you smoke it 

ELON MUSK:
Almost never. I mean, it's-

JOE ROGAN:
How does it feel 

ELON MUSK:
I don't actually notice any effect.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, there you go. There was a time where I think it was Ramadan for someone gave some Buddhist monk a bunch of acid.

ELON MUSK:
Okay.

JOE ROGAN:
And he ate it, and it had no effect on him.

ELON MUSK:
I doubt that.

JOE ROGAN:
I would say that too, but I've never meditated to the level that some of these people have where they're constantly meditating all day.
They don't have any material possessions. And all of their energy is spent trying to achieve a certain mindset. I would like to cynically
deny that. I'd like to cynically say, "Hey, just fuck and think the same way I do." They're just hanging out with flip flops on and make
weird noises, but maybe no.

ELON MUSK:
You know, I know a lot of people like weed, and that's fine, but I don't find that it is very good for productivity.

JOE ROGAN:
For you.

ELON MUSK:
Not for me.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. I mean, I would imagine that for someone like you, it's not. For someone like you, it would be more like a cup of coffee, right.
You want to have a latte.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. It's more like the opposite of a cup of coffee.

JOE ROGAN:
What is that 

ELON MUSK:
It's like a cup of coffee in reverse.

JOE ROGAN:
Weed is 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
No, I'm saying you would like more. More like will be beneficial to you. It would be like coffee.

ELON MUSK:
I like to get things done. I like to be useful. That is one of the hardest things to do is to be useful.

JOE ROGAN:
When you say you like to get things done-

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
 like, in terms of like what-

ELON MUSK:
I should get things done.

JOE ROGAN:
 gives you satisfaction  When you complete a project, when something that you invent comes to fruition, and you see people
enjoying it, that feeling.

ELON MUSK:
Yes, doing something useful for other people that I like doing.

JOE ROGAN:
That's interesting for other people.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
So, that, do you think that that is maybe the way you recognize that you have this unusual position in the culture where you can
uniquely influence certain things because of this  I mean, you essentially have a gift, right.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
I mean, you would think it was a curse, but I'm sure it's been fueled by many, many years of discipline and learning. But you,
essentially, have a gift and that you have this radical sort of creativity engine when it comes to innovation and technology. It's like
you're just you're going at very high RPMs.

ELON MUSK:
All the time. That doesn't stop.

JOE ROGAN:
What is that like 

ELON MUSK:
I don't know what would happen if I got into a sensory deprivation tank.

JOE ROGAN:
Let's try it.

ELON MUSK:
It sounds a little concerning.

JOE ROGAN:
But why 

ELON MUSK:
It's like running the engine with no resistance. That is-

JOE ROGAN:
Is that what it is though  Maybe it's not.

ELON MUSK:
Maybe it's fine. I don't know.

JOE ROGAN:
How much-

ELON MUSK:
I'll try it. I'll try it.

JOE ROGAN:
Have you ever-

ELON MUSK:
It's fine.

JOE ROGAN:
 experimented with meditation or anything 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
What do you do, or what have you done rather 

ELON MUSK:
I mean, just sort of sit there, and be quiet, and then repeat some mantra, which acts as a focal point. It does still the mind. It does still
the mind, but I don't find myself drawn to it frequently.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think that perhaps productivity is maybe more attractive to you than enlightenment or even the concept of whatever
enlightenment means. Like, what are you trying to achieve when you're meditating all the time  With you, it seems like almost like
there's a franticness to your creativity that comes out of this burning furnace. And in order for you to like calm that thing down, you
might have to throw too much water on it.

ELON MUSK:
It's like a never-ending explosion.

JOE ROGAN:
Like what is it like  Try to explain it to a dumb person like me. What's going on 

ELON MUSK:
Never-ending explosion.

JOE ROGAN:
It's just constant ideas just bouncing around.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Damn.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
So, when everybody leaves, it's just Elon sitting at home brushing his teeth, just bunch ideas bouncing around your head.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, all the time.

JOE ROGAN:
When did you realize that that's not the case with most people 

ELON MUSK:
I think, when I was, Idon't know, five or six or something. I thought I was insane.

JOE ROGAN:
Why did you think you were insane 

ELON MUSK:
Because it is clear that other people do not. Their mind wasn't exploding with ideas all the time.

JOE ROGAN:
So, they weren't expressing it. They weren't talking about it all day. And you realized by the time you were five or six like, "Oh, they're
probably not even getting this thing that I'm getting."

ELON MUSK:
No. It was just strange. It was like, "Hmm, kind of strange."That was my conclusion, kind of strange.

JOE ROGAN:
But did you feel diminished by it in any way  Like knowing that this is a weird thing that you really probably couldn't commiserate with
other people, they wouldn't understand you.

ELON MUSK:
I hope they wouldn't find out because they might like put me away or something.

JOE ROGAN:
You thought that 

ELON MUSK:
For a second, yes.

JOE ROGAN:
When you were little 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. They put people away. What if they put me away 

JOE ROGAN:
Like when you were little, you thought this 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Wow. Well, you thought, "This is so radically different than the people that are around me if they find out I got this stream coming in."

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa.

ELON MUSK:
But, you know, I was only like five or six probably.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think this is like   I mean, there's outliers biologically. You mean, there's people that are 7 foot 9, there's people that have
giant hands, there's people that have eyes that are 20/15 vision. There's always the outliers. Do you feel like you like caught this, like
you have got some   you're like on some weird innovation creativity sort of wave that's very unusual  Like you tapped into   I mean,
just think of the various things you may have accomplished in a very short amount of time, and you're constantly doing this. That's a
weird   You're a weird person, right.

ELON MUSK:
Right, I agree.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Like what if there's a million Elon Musks 

ELON MUSK:
Well, that would be very, very weird.

JOE ROGAN:
Whoa.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, it would be pretty weird. I agree.

JOE ROGAN:
Real weird.

ELON MUSK:
Definitely.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
What if there were a million Joe Rogans 

JOE ROGAN:
There probably is. There's probably two million. Imean, I think that's the case with a lot of folks.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I mean, but, like, you know, my goal is like try to do useful things, try to maximize the probability for the future's good, make
the future exciting, something you look forward to, you know. You know, with Tesla, I want to try to make things that people love.
Like, how do you think you could buy that you really love, that really give you joy  So rare, so rare. I wish there were more things.
That's what we try to do. Just make things that somebody loves.

JOE ROGAN:
When you-

ELON MUSK:
That's so difficult.

JOE ROGAN:
When you think about things that someone loves, like, do you specifically think about like what things would improve people's
experience, like what would change the way people interface with life that would make them more relaxed or more happy  You really
think, like, when you're thinking about things like that, is that like one of your considerations  Like what could I do that would help
people-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
 that maybe they wouldn't be able to figure out 

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. Like what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better  Like, you know, like so, I think, a future where we
are a space-faring civilization and out there among the stars. This is very exciting. This makes me look forward to a future. This
makes me want that future. You know, the things, there need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning.

ELON MUSK:
You wake up in the morning, you look forward to the day, you look forward to thefuture. And a future where we are a space-faring
civilization and out there among the stars, I think, that's very exciting. That is a thing we want; whereas, if we knew we would not be a
space-faring civilization but forever confined to Earth, this would not be a good future. That would be very sad, I think.

JOE ROGAN:
It would be so sad in terms-

ELON MUSK:
Like I don't want a sad future.

JOE ROGAN:
 just the finite lifespan of the Earth itself-

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
 and the solar system itself. But even though it's possibly   You know, Imean, how long do they feel like the sun and the solar
system is going to exist  How many hundreds of millions of years 

ELON MUSK:
Well, it's probably, if you're saying when does the sun boil the oceans-

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
About 500 million years.

JOE ROGAN:
So, is it sad that we never leave because in 500 million years, that happens  Is that what you're saying 

ELON MUSK:
No. I just think like if there are two futures, and one future us we're out there among the stars, and the things we read about and see
in science fiction movies, the good ones are true, and we have these starships, and we're going see what other planets are like, and
we're a multi-planet species, and the scope and scale of consciousness is expanded across many civilizations, and many planets,
and many star systems, this is a great future. This is a wonderful thing to me. And that's what we should strive for.

JOE ROGAN:
But that's biological travel. That's cells traveling physically to another location.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you think that's definitely where we're going 

ELON MUSK:
No.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I don't think so either. I used to think so. And, now, I'm thinking more likely less than ever. Like almost every day less likely.

ELON MUSK:
We can definitely go to the moon and Mars.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Do you think we will colonize 

ELON MUSK:
I think we will go to the asteroid belt. And we can go to the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, even get to Pluto.

JOE ROGAN:
That'd be the craziest place ever if we colonize Mars, and reform it, and turn it into like a big Jamaica. Just oceans and-

ELON MUSK:
I think, we should. I think that would be great.

JOE ROGAN:
I mean, imagine that there is-

ELON MUSK:
That would be great. Amazing.

JOE ROGAN:
It's possible, right 

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
We can turn the whole thing into Cancún.

ELON MUSK:
Well-

JOE ROGAN:
I mean, over time.

ELON MUSK:
It wouldn't be easy but yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
You could just warm   Youcould warm it up.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, you can warm it up. You could add air. You get some waterthere. I mean, over time, hundreds of millions of years or whatever
it takes.

ELON MUSK:
We'll be a multi-planet species.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, that would be amazing.

ELON MUSK:
We're a multi-planet species.

JOE ROGAN:
If we could-

ELON MUSK:
That's what we want to be-

JOE ROGAN:
 legitimately like air-condition-

ELON MUSK:
Great.

JOE ROGAN:
 Saturn.

ELON MUSK:
I'm pro-human.

JOE ROGAN:
Me too. Yeah, me too.

ELON MUSK:
I love humanity. I think it's great.

JOE ROGAN:
We're glad as a robot that you love humans because we love you too, and we don't want you to kill us and eat us. And-

ELON MUSK:
I mean, you know, strangely, I think a lot of people don't like humanity and see it as a blight, but I do not.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, I think one of those   I think, part of that is just they've been   you know, they've been struggling. When people struggle, they
associate their struggle with other people. They never internalize their problems. They look to other people as holding them back,
and people suck, and fuck people, and it's just   You know, it's a never ending cycle. But not always. Again, most people are really
good. Most people, the vast majority.

ELON MUSK:
This may sound corny.

JOE ROGAN:
It does sound corny.

ELON MUSK:
But love is the answer.

JOE ROGAN:
It is you answer.

ELON MUSK:
Yup.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, it is. It sounds corny because we're all scared. You know, we're all scared of trying to love people, being rejected, or someone
taking advantage of you because you're trying to be loving.

ELON MUSK:
Sure.

JOE ROGAN:
What if we all could just relax and love each other 

ELON MUSK:
It wouldn't hurt to have more love in the world.

JOE ROGAN:
It definitely wouldn't hurt.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It would be great.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, we should do that.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, I agree, man.

ELON MUSK:
Like really.

JOE ROGAN:
How are you going to fix that  Do you have a love machine you're working on 

ELON MUSK:
No, but probably spend more time with your friends and less time on social media.

JOE ROGAN:
Now, deleting social media from your applications, from your phones, will that give you a 10% boost to happiness  What do you
think the percentage is 

ELON MUSK:
I think probably something like that, yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, a good 10%.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, I mean, the only thing I've kept is Twitter because I kind of like meet some means of getting a message out, you know.

JOE ROGAN:
Right.

ELON MUSK:
Well, that's about it. So far so good.

JOE ROGAN:
Well, what's interesting with you, you actually occasionally engage with people on Twitter.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, that's-

JOE ROGAN:
What percentage of that is a good idea 

ELON MUSK:
Good question.

JOE ROGAN:
Probably 10%, right  It's hard.

ELON MUSK:
It's mostly   I think, it's on balance, more good than bad, but there's definitely some bad. So-.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you ever-

ELON MUSK:
Hopefully, the good outweighs the bad.

JOE ROGAN:
Do you ever think about how odd it is, the weird feeling that you get when someone says something shitty to you on Twitter, and you
read it  That weird feeling. This weird little negative jolt. It's like a subjective negative jolt of energy that you don't really need to
absorb, but you do anyway. Like, "I want to fuck this guy. Fuck him."

ELON MUSK:
I mean, there's a lot of negativity on Twitter.

JOE ROGAN:
It is, but it's a weird in it's form. Like the way, if you ingest it as if you're like   you try to be like a little scientist as you're ingesting it,
you're like, "How weird is this " And I'm even getting upset at some strange person saying something mean to me. It's not even
accurate.

ELON MUSK:
I mean, the vast number of negative comments, for the vast majority, I just ignore them, the vast majority.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Every now and again, you have draw in, something not good.

JOE ROGAN:
It's not good.

ELON MUSK:
You make mistakes.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes, you can make mistakes.

ELON MUSK:
We can make some mistakes.

JOE ROGAN:
We're all human. We can make mistakes. Yeah, it's hard. And people love it when you say something, and you take it back, and
they're like, "Fuck you. We saved it forever. I'll fucking screenshot that shit, bitch. You had that thought. You had that thought." I'm
like, "Well, I deleted it." "Not good enough. You had the thought. I'm better than you. I never had that thought. You had that thought,
you piece of shit. Look, I saved it. I put it on my blog. Bad thought."

ELON MUSK:
Yeah. I'm not sure why people think that anyone would think that deleting a tweet makes them go away. It's like, "Hello, been on the
internet for a while."

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Well it's even like-

ELON MUSK:
Anything is forever.

JOE ROGAN:
And the thing is they don't want you to be able to delete it because the problem is if you don't delete it, and you don't believe it
anymore, it's really hard to say, "Hey, that thing above, I don't really believe that anymore. I changed the way I view things."

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Because people would go, "Well, fuck you. I have that over there. I'm going to just take that. I'm not going to payattention to that shit
you wrote underneath it."

ELON MUSK:
It's on your permanent record.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. It's forever like a tattoo.

ELON MUSK:
Like high school, "We'll put this on yourpermanent record."

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. It's like a tattoo. You keep it.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah. Well, it's this thing where there's a lack of compassion. It's a lack of compassion issue. People are just like intentionally shitty
to each other all the time online, and trying to catch-

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
They're more trying to catch people doing something that's arrestable, like a cop trying to, like, get, you know, arrests on his record.
It's like they're trying to catch you for something, more than they're logically looking at it thinking it's a bad thing that you've done, or
that it's an idea they don't agree with so much, they needed to insult you. They're trying tocatch you.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person.

JOE ROGAN:
Yes.

ELON MUSK:
Way easier.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah.

JOE ROGAN:
It's weird. It's not a normal way of human interacting. It's cheating.

ELON MUSK:
True.

JOE ROGAN:
You're not supposed to be able to interactso easily when the people are not looking at.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
You would never do that. Don't be so mean when somebody looking in their eyes. If you did, you'd feel like shit.

ELON MUSK:
Most people.

JOE ROGAN:
Yeah, unless you're a sociopath, you'd feel terrible.

ELON MUSK:
Yes.

JOE ROGAN:
Elon Musk, this has been a pleasure.

ELON MUSK:
Yeah, likewise.

JOE ROGAN:
It really has been.

ELON MUSK:
It's been an honor. Thank you for having me.

JOE ROGAN:
Thanks for doing this because I know you don't do a lot of long form stuff like this. I hope I didn't weird you out, and I hope you don't
get mad that you smoked weed.

ELON MUSK:
I mean-

JOE ROGAN:
It's not bad. It's legal. We're in California.This is just as legal as this whiskey we've been drinking.

ELON MUSK:
Exactly.

JOE ROGAN:
This is all good, right 

ELON MUSK:
Cheers.

JOE ROGAN:
Cheers. Thank you. Is there any message you would like to put out other than love is the answer, because I think you really nailed it
with that.

ELON MUSK:
No. I think, you know, I think people should be nicer to each other, and give more credit to others, and don't assume that they're
mean until you know they're actually mean. You know, just, it's easy to demonize people. You're usually wrong about it. People are
nicer than you think. Give people more credit.

JOE ROGAN:
I couldn't agree more. And I want to thank you not just for all the crazy innovations you've come up with and your constant flow of
ideas but that you choose to spread that idea, which is very vulnerable, but it's very honest, and it resonates with me.

ELON MUSK:
It's true.

JOE ROGAN:
And I believe it.

ELON MUSK:
It's true.

JOE ROGAN:
I believe it's true too. So, thank you.

ELON MUSK:
You're welcome.

JOE ROGAN:
All you assholes out there, be nice. Be nice, bitch. All right. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Elon.

ELON MUSK:
All right, thank you.

JOE ROGAN:
Good night, everybody.
